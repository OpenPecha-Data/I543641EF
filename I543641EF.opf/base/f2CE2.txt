35. SaṅgasamatikramaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva transcend all attachments (sarvasaṅgasamatikrama)?W
hat is called ‘attachment’ means the manifestation of viewpoints (dṛṣṭiparyutthāna) on the dharmas.The bodhisatva transc
ends all attachments since he is free from any manifestation of viewpoints (dṛṣṭiparyutthāna).Just as the wind (vāyu) is
not attached to the vault of the sky, so the bodhisatva who is endowed with the wind-like thought is not attached to an
y living being.
