17. DharmaratnanidhānaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva grasp the treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmarat
nanidhāna) of the Awakened Lords?Son of good family, the treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) of the Awaken
ed Lords is imperishable (akṣaya).Thus, as many as are the entrances into the essential character of behaviour in all li
ving beings, so many are the entrances into knowledge which is the gate into the treasury of the Dharma Jewel of the Awa
kened Lords (yāvantaḥ sarvasatvānāṃ caritalakṣaṇānupraveśās tāvad api buddhānāṃ bhagavatāṃ dharmaratnanidhānamukhajñānap
raveśāḥ).Just as the behaviour of living beings is imperishable and endless, in the same way, the treasury of the Dharma
Jewel of the Awakened Lords is also imperishable and endless (yathā satvacaritam akṣayam anatam evam api buddhānāṃ bhag
avatāṃ dharmaratnanidhānāny akṣayāṇi anatāni).From the night (rātri) when the Tathāgata attained awakening (bodhiprāpta)
to the night of his extinction (parinirvāṇa), the treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) has been explained,
is being explained, and will be explained by the Tathāgata. All of them are what they really are (tathatā), not differe
nt from what they are (avitathatā), and nothing else but what they are (ananyathā).Why is it called ‘such’ (kasmāt tathe
ti)? Since it is the entrance into the peace of suchness, it is called 'such’ (tathatāśāntisaṃprasthitatvāt tatheti).Why
is it called ‘suchness without error’ (kasmāt avitatheti)? Since it is the entrance into the highest truth, it is calle
d ‘suchness without error.’ (paramārthasatyasaṃprasthitatvāt tatheti)Why is it called ‘suchness that is not other’ (kasm
āt ananyatatheti)? Since he seeks nothing else but the essential nature (svabhāva), there is no other.Further, as for th
e treasury of the Dharma Jewels of the Awakened Lords, even though living beings of a system of threefold thousand great
thousand worlds (trisāhasramahāsahasralokadhātuparyāpanna) were as learned as (bāhuśruta) Ānanda, all of them would not
be able to understand even a syllable (akṣara) in hundreds of thousands of millions of aeons (kalpakoṭīśatasahasra); an
d further they would not be able to teach even a single meaning (ekārtha) - such a true teaching (yathābhūtadeśanā) is t
he treasury of Dharma Jewels belonging to the Awakened Lords.The bodhisatvas, having grasped it, do not forget (saṃpramo
ṣayati) any letter or lose any meaning (artha), and they please (ārādhyati) all living beings, gratify (ārāgayati) all t
he Buddhas, vanquish all the Evil Ones (sarvamāra), subjugate all other heretics (sarvānyatīrthika), and appease all vic
es (sarvakleśa). Thus they understand the Dharma Jewel Words.In this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva grasps the 
treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) of the Awakened Lords.
