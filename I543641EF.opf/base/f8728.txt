24. TathāgatamudrāHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva become skilled in knowing suchness without any differ
entiation (tathatāvinirbhāgajñānakuśala) as sealed with the seal of the tathāgata (tathāgatamudrāmudrita)?With regard to
what we called ‘being sealed with the seal of the tathāgata (tathāgatamudrāmudrita),’ suchness without any differentiat
ion (tathatāvinirbhāga) is the seal, and it is without distinction, activity (apravṛtti), attachment (abhiniveśa), agita
ting, or being agitated, and thus it cannot be shaken (na kampayituṃ śakyate) by the world with its gods, humans, or ant
i-gods (sadevamānuṣāsureṇa lokena).Why? The world with its gods, humans and anti-gods is indeed sealed with that seal,an
d the seal of the tathāgata is the seal which is unoriginated, empty (śūnyatā), signless (animitta), wishless (apraṇihit
a), unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), free from desire (virāga), just as it is (tathatā), the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi), and
open space (gagana).Just as the seal in the empty space (gaganamudrā) does not appear, the seal of the tathāgata does n
ot appear to even the five kinds of sight as it is sealed by the seal having its own essential character (svalakṣaṇamudr
āmudrita).All the explanations about the dharma and the pertaining conventions (dharmavyavahāra) given by the tathāgata 
are sealed with the seal of the tathāgata in that way.Among them, those which pertain to the sphere of consciousness est
ablish the dharma;but those which are not established in consciousness do not establish any dharma, and do not different
iate between any dharma;those which are sealed with the seal of the tathāgata do not differentiate suchness (tathatā).Wh
at then is the differentiation of suchness (nānātathatā)?It is those which differentiate (kalpayanti) the dharmas of sup
erior, mediocre, and inferior (hīnamadhyaviśiṣṭa),those, which do not construct any dharma and do not make any different
iation, do not differentiate suchness,and, no matter how many things are imagined and constructed (kalpitavikalpita), th
ey do not differentiate suchness.Just like all living beings wander about in empty space, the sphere of empty space (gag
anadhātu) is not connected with them, in that way, all living beings wander about in suchness, but they do not tarnish s
uchness.And here, the bodhisatva who can understand such dharmas is sealed with the seal of the tathāgata, and he does n
ot tarnish suchness.
