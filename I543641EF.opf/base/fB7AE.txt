Son of good family, there are eight purities of patience of the bodhisatvas, which are like empty space. What are these e
ight? (ime kulputra aṣṭaviśuddhayo bodhisatvasya kṣāntir gaganasamā bhavati. kathame aṣṭau?)a) the purity of patience wi
thout any hostile intent toward all living beings just as there is no hostile intent in empty space (apratihataṃ gaganaṃ
sarvasatvāpratighacittasya kṣāntipariśuddhiḥ).;ŚikṣMS: apratihataṃ gaganaṃ sarvvasatvāpratighacittasya kṣāntipariśuddhi

菩薩行忍於諸有情平等和合清淨亦爾。d) the purity of unimpaired patience [although] with diminishing body and thought just as empty space i

without all bad dispositions;f) the purity of patience beyond mind (manas) and objective support (ālambana) just as emp

empty space is not produced and does not occur;h) the purity of patience filled with friendliness (maitrī) just as empt

of patience of the bodhisatvas, which are like empty space.
