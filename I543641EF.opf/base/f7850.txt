123 There is a principle that minds and all dharmas are just like open space. Listen to my instruction of entering into t
he [principle,] step by step (krameṇa).124 Just as there is no high or low in open space, so there is no superior or inf
erior in the nature of the dharma (dharmatā), then how could we pay respect something else [except for open space]?125 J
ust as there is not any origination nor cessation perceived in open space, so there is no thought-construction (vikalpa)
in all dharmas which are unborn.126 Just as there is no decreasing or increasing perceived in open space, so all dharma
s do not increase or decrease.127 Just as there is no darkness or defilement, the nature of mind (cittaprakṛti) is lumin
ous, thus it is undefiled.128 Just as open space is not delighted even by the sunlight or moonlight, our thoughts are al
so not agitated by anything.129 Just as open space is not damaged in the hail of spears and arrows, so the Son of the Vi
ctorious One (jinaputra) is not afflicted by any suffering coming from all directions.130 Just as the open space is not 
delighted by the rain of ambrosia (amṛtavarṣa), the bodhisatva is not pleased with any gain or honour (lābhasatkāra).131
Just as the open space never makes discriminative construction on praise or blame, so the bodhisatva is stable and unwa
vering in pleasure and suffering (sukhaduḥka).132 Just as the open space is never shaken while the whole ground is shaki
ng, just so the bodhisatva is never agitated while this world is shaking.133 Just as the open space is not burnt even wh
en the fire breaks out at the end of the aeon (kalpoddāha), so the bodhisatva is stable and is not burnt by any vice (kl
eśa).134 Just as the open space remains without birth or death, so all dharmas remains in the absolute reality (dharmadh
ātu) without going or coming.135 Just as all manifestations of forms (rūpāvabhāsa) appear in open space, so all manifest
ations of dharmas (dharmāvabhāsa) appear in the absolute reality (dharmadhātu).136 Due to the absence of distinguishing 
marks and form, the open space cannot be seen. When you understand the nature of thoughts in this way, it will be like t
he open space.137 The open space is only a name (nāmamātra), without color and form (varṇasaṃsthāna), in the same way, t
hought, mind, and consciousness (cittamanovijñāna) are illustrated (paridīpita) by name.138 Just as the open space is bo
undless and ungraspable (agrāhya) everywhere, the great power of insight (prajñāmahānubhāva) is the same as the sameness
of open space (gaganasamasadṛśa).139 Just as a bird flying in the sky does not leave any trace, one who practices for a
wakening does not have any distinguishing mark (nimitta) in their behaviour.140 Just as, the body is originally the same
as open space, so the essential nature of the parts of personality (skandhasvabhāva) is the same as open space.141 It i
s said that the four elements (caturdhātu) are the same as open space, in the same way, even in the fire at the end of t
he aeon (kalpoddāha), these elements are still same as the open space.142 Just as the open space cannot be filled up wit
h even all beings, so the series of thoughts (cittasaṃtāna) also cannot be filled up with all objects of sense (sarvaviṣ
aya).143 The great words with the lion’s roar (siṃhanāda), the words given by the protector of the world (lokanātha), an
d the supermundane insight (lokottaraprajñā), you should find satisfaction in these teachings.144 Just as the end of the
open space cannot be perceived because it is too extensive (vipula), just so the teachings of the buddha also cannot be
attained.145 All dharmas are the buddha. He who knows this truth will not destroy existence nor remain in existence.146
The wise, discerning existence and non-existence (bhāvābhāva), remain in the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi), but never ta
ke the view of existence or non-existence.147 Even though emptiness (śūnyatā) is proclaimed by sound (śabda), but emptin
ess is not in the sound. It is beyond sound and inexpressible, thus it is called ‘emptiness.’148 Even though all buddhas
teach emptiness (śūnyatā), it is inexpressible. That is called emptiness, thus its meaning (artha) is also inexpressibl
e.149 By using metaphors such as illusion, mirage, dream, reflection, echo, etc. (māyāmarīcisvapnapratibhāsapratiśrutkād
i), the leaders (nāyaka) teach the dharma.150 In order to lead many beings, metaphors are taught. In this peaceful dharm
as, there is no obstacle (pratipakṣa) perceived.151 Even though all dharmas are without essential character (alakṣaṇa), 
it is taught by its essential character. Something characterized or something not characterized (lakṣyālakṣya), anything
does not exist in the the absolute reality (dharmadhātu).152 What to be characterized (lakṣya) has the character of ope
n space (gaganalakṣaṇa), and the character of open space is not found. Those who fully understand this principle are the
bodhisatvas.153 He, who is not attached nor bound even to the smallest thing, who is without activity (aprapañca), and 
who is free from discursive thinking (niḥprapañca), is called the bodhisatva.154 He who is not separated from living bei
ngs, who remains among living beings, and who understand the nature of living beings (satvasvabhāva) is called the bodhi
satva.155 Having heard that living beings are originally extinguished, not being afraid of that, such is the armor (saṃn
āha) of heroes, the entrance of awakening.156 Even if a magician, after having created many creatures, killed them all, 
there was no killing; the essential character of living beings is exactly like that.157 The natures of illusion, living 
beings, extinction, and the buddha (māyāsatvanirvāṇabuddha) have one essence, and he understands the own nature is the a
bsence of the nature.158 The bodhisatva Gaganagañja has attained the imperishable treasury (akṣayagañja) from the open s
pace, thus this treasury will not be exhausted, even while satisfying all living beings.159 Since the stream (nadī) of i
mmeasurable merits (puṇya) purifies this treasury, in the imperishability of all dharmas, you should see the true state 
of all dharmas (dharmāṇāṃ dharmatā).160 If you understand that all dharmas have arisen from causes, their treasury will 
be inexhaustible, and the treasury of the dharma (dharmagañja) will be inconceivable.161 The protector of the world (lok
anātha) has taught the inexhaustibility (akṣayatā) of these four dharmas, to wit, living beings (satva), open space (gag
ana), the thought of awakening (bodhicitta), and the dharma of the Buddha (buddhadharma).162 If those were material thin
gs, those will be exhausted; but since those are not material things, those are inexhaustible, thus it is called ‘inexha
ustible.’163 Since the dharma is momentary, even if the dharma is consumed, it would never be exhausted. There is nothin
g exhausted in that inexhaustibility, thus it is called ‘inexhaustibility (akṣayatā).’164 The bodhisatva, who understand
s this teaching of the dharma (dharmadeśanā), will attain awakening without any difficulty and enter into awakening.

When this versified teaching was taught, one hundred thousand bodhisatvas attained the tolerance that all things are unbo
rn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti),and twelve thousand sons of gods (devaputra) dwelling in the vault of the open space (gagan
atala) generated the thought of incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi).

Kutūhalajāta

At that time, the bodhisatva, the great being Kutūhalajāta came and sat down in this assembly, addressed himself to the L
ord: “O Lord, thinking about where this sound [of the dharma (dharmaśabda)] is coming from (niścar-), I am absolutely as
tonished (āścaryaprāpta).”The Lord said: “Son of good family, you should ask the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, and he will ans
wer to you.”The bodhisatva Kutūhalajāta said to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, I am absolutely astonis
hed (kutūhalajāta), thinking about where this sound [of the dharma (dharmaśabda)] is coming from.”Gaganagañja said: “Wha
t do you think, son of good family (tat kiṃ manyase kulaputra)? Where is an echo (pratiśrutkā)coming from?”Kutūhalajāta 
said: “Son of good family, the sound of an echo comes from the sound uttered by another person (paraśabdavijñapti).”Gaga
nagañja said: “Son of good family, does an echo (pratiśrutkā) have body, thought, form, color, or shape (kāyacittarūpava
rṇasaṃsthāna)?Kutūhalajāta said: “No, son of good family.”Gaganagañja said: “Quite so, son of good family. Just as an ec
ho does not really exist (apariniṣpanna) and it is merely the perception of sounds (śabdasaṃprāpaṇa), in the same way, [
the sound of the dharma coming from] open space does not really exist and it is also the perception of sounds.”Kutūhalaj
āta said: “Son of good family, who perceives this sound? where is this sound coming from?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good
family, the recognition of knowledge (jñānaprativijñapti) is incomprehensible. Even though we think that it is coming f
rom this open space because of the reflection of our mind, it is neither going nor coming. The resonance of sound is jus
t coming.Son of good family, you should examine its profoundness (gaṃbhīra) in the perspective of dependent origination 
(pratītyasamutpāda).Even though the result arises from the causes, the causes is not transferred to the attainment of fr
uits (phalodaya), but when there is no cause, there is no arising of result.That is to say, this dharma is produced as a
result (phala) from causes and conditions (hetupratyaya), but even so there is no activity (āniṃjya) nor agent (kāraka)
in them.Those who perceive things thus are beyond the fruition of causes (visāmagrī).Why is that? This is because the L
ord said that understanding defilements (saṃkleśa) is purification (vyavadāna); suppressing defilements (saṃkleśasaṃghāt
a) is not purification as the essential character (svabhāvalakṣaṇa) of defilement is purification.In fact, both defileme
nt and purification (saṃkleśavyavadāna) are just conventional expressions (saṃketapada).Defilement and purification (saṃ
kleśavyavadāna) are not apprehended within the limit of the ultimate truth (paramārthakoṭi).Since the limit of the ultim
ate truth is beyond limit (akoṭi), that which is beyond limit is the true limit (bhūtakoṭi).The true limit (bhūtakoṭi) i
s the limit of emptiness (śūnyatākoṭi).The the limit of emptiness (śūnyatākoṭi) is the limit of the self (ātmakoṭi).The 
limit of the self is the limit of all dharmas (sarvadharmakoṭi).Why is that? Concerning all dharmas, the limit of them, 
the limit of emptiness, and the limit of tranquility; being unattached to the gate into these three limits is attaining 
the unattached knowledge to any dharma.Then Śāriputra the Elder addressed himself to the bodhisatva Kutūhalajāta: “Son o
f good family, why are you called Kutūhalajāta?”Kutūhalajāta said: “Venerable Śāriputra, wherever you have wished and st
ruggled for the dharma, have you wondered about it?”Śāriputra said: “Quite so, son of good family.”Kutūhalajāta said: “I
n the same way, Venerable Śāriputra, I have wished and struggled for all dharmas here and there, but I still wonder abou
t when I can fulfill all the qualities of the buddha. That is why I am called Kutūhalajāta.I wonder about all practices 
of the bodhisatva (sarvabodhisatvacaryā) and the knowledge of entering into the thoughts and deeds of all living beings 
(sarvasatvacittacaritāpraveśajñāna). That is why I am called Kutūhalajāta.What I wonder about is without any knowledge o
r any entrance. That is way I called Kutūhalajāta.That on which I wonder about is without weak point (avatāra) concernin
g any vice (sarvakleśa) or any work of Māra (sarvamārakarma). That is why I am called Kutūhalajāta.”Then the Śāriputra t
he Elder addressed himself to the Lord:“O Lord, even though this name of good person proclaims and teaches all dharmas o
f the buddha, he is not attached to any dharma of the buddha. It is a wonderful to teach all dharmas of the buddha witho
ut any attachment.”

Ratnaśrī

Then the bodhisatva, Ratnaśrī by name, came and sat down in this assembly, said to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“With refer
ence to the teaching of concentration (samādhiprakāśanam ārabhya), son of good family, may you elucidate (pratibhātu) wh
at kind of concentration should be purified (samādhipariśodhana).Thus addressed (evam ukte), the bodhisatva Gaganagañja 
said this to the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī:
