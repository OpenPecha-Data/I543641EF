19. SatvādiviśuddhiHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva bring all living beings to maturity (paripācayati) g
iven the fact that they are originally pure (satvādiviśuddhi).The realm of living beings (satvadhātu), son of good famil
y, is originally pure (ādiviśuddhi), and thus their roots have no basis (avastuka).The bodhisatva, son of good family, h
aving understood that the roots of all dharmas are completely cut off, brings living beings to maturity, and then he doe
s not hold the view of a self (ātmadṛṣṭi), the view of a living being (satvadṛṣṭi), the view of a life principle (jīvadṛ
ṣṭi), or the view of a person (pudgaladṛṣṭi).Again he thinks (punas tasyaivaṃ bhavati): “what is called ‘living being (s
atva)’ is a misunderstanding (viparyasta). Because of being occupied (paryavasthāna) with the view of cause (hetudṛṣṭi),
ignorance (avidyā), existence (bhāva), thirst (tṛṣṇā), and unreal mental constructions (abhūtaparikalpa), it is called 
‘living being.’”But the bodhisatva still teaches the Dharma (dharmaṃ deśayati) to living beings in order to get rid of v
ices which originate from misunderstanding (viparyāsasamutthitakleśaprahāṇa), and he does not forget (na vipraṇāśayati) 
substances (bhāva).Since he is devoid of a living being (niḥsatva), and detached from a living being (satvaviveka), he b
rings living beings to maturity.Thus the bodhisatva brings living beings to maturity (sarvasatvān paripācayati) by the o
riginal purity (ādiviśuddhi).
