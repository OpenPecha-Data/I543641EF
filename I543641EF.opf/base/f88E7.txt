Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, what is the supramundane path (lokottaramārga) of
the bodhisatvas, the great beings?”At these words, the Lord replied to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:Son of good family, w
hat is called the supramundane path (lokottaramārga) is the six perfections (ṣaṭpāramitā), thirty-seven dharmas which ar
e the wings of awakening (saptatriṃśadbodhipakṣikadharma), peaceful meditation (śamatha), expanded vision (vipaśyana), f
our means of attraction (catvāri saṃgrahavastūni), four meditaions (catvāri dhyānāni), four immeasurables (catvāry apram
āṇāni), four formless states of meditation (catasra ārūpyasamāpattaya), and five supernormal knowledges (pañcābhijñā). S
on of good family, this is the supramundane path of the bodhisatvas.The world (loka) is the five parts of the personalit
y (pañcaskandha).Thus, having known that the form (rūpa) is impermanent (anitya), suffering (duḥkha), selfless (anātma),
tranquil (śānta), empty (śūnya), without distinguishing marks (animitta), wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (anabhis
aṃskṛta), unborn, unproduced, dependently originated, isolated, cannot be grasped (agrāhya), without basis (anālaya), un
originated, like an illusion (māyā), like a dream (svapna), like a mirage (marīci), like the moon reflected in water (ud
akacandra), like an echo (pratiśrutkā), like a reflection (pratibhāsa), like a reflected image (pratibimba), and like gr
ass, trees, walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), the bodhisatva gives a gift, and enters into
the suchness of giving (dānatathatā) through the suchness of form (rūpatathatā).Then he understands the suchness of tra
nsforming (pariṇāmanatathatā) through the suchness of giving (dānatathatā), the suchness of awakening (bodhitathatā) thr
ough the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living being (satvatathatā) through the suchness of awakening, the su
chness of the self (ātmatathatā) through the suchness of living being, and the suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatatha
tā) through the suchness of the self. This the suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness, 
is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Son of good family, because he g
ives a gift by understanding suchness, this giving is the supramundane path (lokottaramārga) of bodhisatvas.In the same 
way, having known that the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are im
permanent, the bodhisatva gives a gift.Having known that the consciousness (vijñāna) is suffering (duḥkha), selfless (an
ātma), tranquil (śānta), empty (śūnya), without distinguishing marks (animitta), wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (a
nabhisaṃskṛta), unborn, unproduced, and dependently originated, he gives a gift.Having known that the consciousness (vij
ñāna) is isolated, cannot be grasped (agrāhya), without basis (anālaya), unoriginated, like an illusion (māyā), like a d
ream (svapna), like a mirage (marīci), like the moon reflected in water (udakacandra), like a reflection (pratibhāsa), l
ike a reflected image (pratibimba), and has the character of being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), he gives a gif
t, and thus understands the suchness of giving through the suchness of consciousness.Then he understands the suchness of
transforming (pariṇāmanatathatā) through the suchness of giving (dānatathatā), the suchness of awakening (bodhitathatā)
through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living being (satvatathatā) through the suchness of awakening, th
e suchness of the self (ātmatathatā) through the suchness of living being, and the suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmat
athatā) through the suchness of the self. This the suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchne
ss, is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Son of good family, since th
e bodhisatva gives a gift by understanding suchness, this giving is the supramudane path (lokottaramārga) of bodhisatva.
Again, son of good family, the bodhisatva, having known that the form (form) is impermanent (anitya), having protected t
he morality, etc., and having known that the form is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamā
rgapratibhāsa), preserves the morality (śīlaṃ rakṣ-).Then he understands the suchness of morality (śīlatathatā) through 
the suchness of form (rūpatathatā), the suchness of transforming (pariṇāmanatathatā) through the suchness of morality, t
he suchness of awakening (bodhitathatā) through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living being (satvatathatā
) through the suchness of awakening, the suchness of the self (ātmatathatā) through the suchness of living being, and th
e suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) through the suchness of the self.The suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharma
tathatā) is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyat
hā). Since he understands the suchness, son of good family, this protecting the morality is the supramunane path of the 
bodhisatvas.In the same way, the bodhisatva, having known that the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousn
ess (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are impermanent, having protected the morality, etc., and having known the character o
f being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), protects the morality, and then understands the suchness of morality (śīl
atathatā) through the suchness of consciousness (vijñānatathatā).He understands the suchness of transforming through the
suchness of morality, the suchness of awakening through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living being thro
ugh the suchness of awakening, the suchness of the self through the suchness of living being, and the suchness of all dh
armas through the suchness of the self. This suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness, is
not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Since the bodhisatva understands s
uchness, this protecting the morality is the supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.Again, son of good family, the bodhistv
a, having known that the form (rūpa) is impermanent, practices patience (kṣānti), makes a vigorous effort (vīryam ārabh-
) according to what he understands, concentrates on meditation (dhyāna), and investigates insight (prajñā). Then he, hav
ing known that from the form is impermanent to the form is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhak
uḍyamārgapratibhāsa), investigates insight.The bodhisatva understands the suchness of insight through the suchness of fo
rm, the suchness of transforming through the suchness of insight, the suchness of awakening through the suchness of tran
sforming, the suchness of living beings through the suchness of awakening, the suchness of the self through the suchness
of living beings, the suchness of all dharmas through the suchness of the self. This suchness of all dharmas (sarvadhar
matathatā) is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (anany
athā). Son of good family, since he understands the suchness, this preserving the morality is the supramunane path of th
e bodhisatvas.In that way, the bodhisatva, having known that the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousnes
s (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are impermanent, having investigated the insight, etc., and having known the character o
f being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), investigates the insight. Then he understands the suchness of insight (pr
ajñātathatā) through the suchness of consciousness (vijñānatathatā), the suchness of transforming through the suchness o
f insight, the suchness of awakening through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living beings through the suc
hness of awakening, the suchness of the self through the suchness of living beings, the suchness of all dharmas through 
the suchness of the self. This suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness, is not different
from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Son of good family, since he understands the suc
hness, this investigating the insight is the supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.Furthermore, son of good family, the bo
dhisatva, having known that the form is impermanent, having cultivated the application of awareness concerned with body 
(kāye kāyānupaśyanā smṛtyupasthānam), etc., having known that the form is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and reflectio
ns (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), cultivates the application of awareness concerned with body.The bodhisatva understa
nds the suchness of body (kāyatathatā) through the suchness of form (rūpatathatā), and understands from the suchness of 
body to the suchness of all dharmas. This suchness of all dharmas is the absence of suchness, is not different from such
ness, and nothing else but suchness. By understanding the suchness, he cultivates the application of awareness concerned
with body, and thus, son of good family, this absence of thought-constructions (nirvikalpa) through the thought-constru
ction connected with body is the supramundane path of the bodhisatvas.In the same way, having known that the feeling, pe
rception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are impermanent, just as the bodhisatva give
s a gift more and more, he expands his feelings, thoughts and dharmas (vedanācittadharma). Thus he, having known that th
e form is impermanent, having practiced the application of awareness which consists in considering the dharma (dharme dh
armānupaśyanā smṛtyupasthānam), etc., having known that the form is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and reflections (tṛ
ṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), applies himself to the awareness which consists in considering the dharma.Thus, he, havin
g known that the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness is impermanent, having practiced the applicati
on of awareness which consists in considering the dharma, etc., having known the character of being beyond information (
avijñāptilakṣaṇa), applies himself to the awareness which consists in considering the dharma.In that way, what is the su
chness of the parts of the personality (skandhatathatā) is the suchness of the application of awareness (smṛtyupasthānat
athatā). What is the suchness of the application of awareness is the suchness of transforming. What is the suchness of t
ransforming is the suchness of awakening. What is the suchness of awakening is the suchness of living beings. What is th
e suchness of living beings is the suchness of the self. What is the suchness of the self is the suchness of all dharmas
. What is the suchness of all dharmas is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness, and nothing else but s
uchness. By understanding the suchness, he applies himself to the awareness concerned with the dharma, he does not make 
any thought-construction through the thought-constructions connected with the dharma, and thus such understanding is the
supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.And so on, just as the bodhisatva develops the application of awareness (smṛtyupast
hāna), in the same way, he develops correct elimination (samyakprahāṇa), the base of magical power (ṛddhipāda), sense or
gans (indriya), power (bala), the limbs of awakening (bodhyaṅga), path (mārga), peaceful meditation (śamatha), expanded 
vision (vipaśyana), four means of attraction (catvāri saṃgrahavastūni), four meditaions (catvāri dhyānāni), four immeasu
rables (catvāry apramāṇāni), four formless states of meditation (catasra ārūpyasamāpattaya), five supernormal knowledges
(pañcābhijñā).Then, since the bodhisatva attains the knowledge of supernatural knowledges (abhijñājñāna) after having k
nown that the form is impermanent, he, having known that the form is suffering (duḥkha), selfless (anātma), tranquil (śā
nta), empty (śūnya), without distinguishing marks (animitta), wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta), unb
orn, dependently originated, isolated, cannot be grasped (agrāhya), without basis (anālaya), unoriginated, like an illus
ion (māyā), like a dream (svapna), like a mirage (marīci), like the moon reflected in water (udakacandra), like an echo 
(pratiśrutkā), like a reflection (pratibhāsa), like a reflected image (pratibimba), and like grass, trees, walls, paths 
and reflection (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), accomplishes the knowledge of supernatural knowledges (abhijñājñāna).In
that way, he accomplishes the knowledge of supernatural knowledges (abhijñājñāna) after having known that the feeling, 
perception, formative factors and consciousness are impermanent. Then he, having known the consciousness (vijñāna) is su
ffering, selfless, tranquil, empty, without distinguishing marks, wishless, unconditioned, unborn, unproduced, dependent
ly originated, isolated, cannot be grasped, without basis, unborn, like an illusion, like a dream, like a mirage, like t
he moon reflected in water, like an echo, like a reflection, like a reflected image, and has the character of being beyo
nd information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), accomplishes supernatural knowledges.To wit, what is the suchness of the parts of the
personality (skandhatathatā) that is the suchness of supernormal knowledges (abhijñātathatā). What is the suchness of s
upernormal knowledges that is the suchness of transforming. What is the suchness of transforming that is the suchness of
awakening. What is the suchness of awakening that is the suchness of living beings. What is the suchness of living bein
gs that is the suchness of the self. What is the suchness of the self that is the suchness of all dharmas. What is the s
uchness of all dharmas that is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness, and nothing else but suchness. B
y understanding the suchness, he accomplishes the knowledge of supernormal knowledges (abhijñājñāna), and thus such unde
rstanding is the supramundane path of the bodhisatvas.Why is that? The supramunane path is to understand the suchness of
form, thus the form is indestructible, uninterrupted, permanent, dependently originated, and non-origination by its own
nature (svabhāvenānutpanna).In the same way, the bodhisatva understands the suchness of feeling, perception, formative 
factors and consciousness, thus consciousness is indestructible, uninterrupted, permanent, dependently originated, and n
on-origination by its own nature (svabhāvānutpatti).Transcending the world of the parts of personality (skandhaloka) is 
not to be attached to the world of form or the world without form, but to teach for living beings in the five state of e
xistence (pañcagatyupapanna) to transcend the world, thus he teaches in that way but does not destroy the world.Why is t
hat? Because the essential character (lakṣaṇa) that the world is impermanent is not destroyed. The world is essentially 
characterized by from suffering, selflessness, peace, emptiness, non-distinguishing mark, wishlessness, the unconditione
d, to suchness, thus this impermanent world is, son of good family, the pure supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.The bod
hisatva established on the pure path (mārgapariśuddhipratiṣṭhita) produces the great light of the dharma (mahāntaṃ dharm
āvabhāsaṃ karoti) for the sake of living beings who are on the wrong path.Then those living beings, having attained the 
light, are also established in the true supramunane path.This path is the most excellent since it is for the sake of the
obtainment of the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa);this path is excellent since it is without any bad thought (sarvākuśa
lacitta);this path is the best since it is to attain the summit (mūrdhan) for the sake of the knowledge of the buddha (b
uddhajñāna);this path is unsurpassed since it releases [living beings] from all the stream of existence (sarvaughottaraṇ
a);this path is unexcelled since it transcends all limited paths (sarvaprādeśikamārga);this path is incomparable since t
here is no concept of contrary (pratipakṣānupalambha);this path is unequalled (asamasama) since it is reciting (saṃgīti)
the path of the previous buddhas (pūrvabuddha);this path leads to happiness since it vanquishes any Māra or adversary (
nihatasarvamārapratyarthika);this path leads to no hindrance since it is the miraculous play (vikrīḍita) by knowing supe
rnormal knowledges (abhijñā) and the base of magical power (ṛddhipāda);this path is without darkness (tamo’ndhakāra) sin
ce it is completely pure radiance by insight (prajñā);this path is righteous since it is without deception or guile (māy
āśāṭhya);this path is luminous since there is no crooked thinking (akuṭilacitta);this path is impartial since it has the
equal attitude to all living beings (sarvasatvasamacittatā);this path is vast (vipula) since it is open to all living b
eings (sarvasatvāvakāśa);this path is wide since there is no conflict between one another;this path is in the state of t
ranquility since it leads to the unbornness (anutpāda);this path is firm with merits (puṇya) because of the perfection o
f generosity (dānapāramitā);this path is without affliction (saṃtāpa) because of the perfection of morality (śīlapāramit
ā);this path is indestructible because of the perfection of forbearance (kṣāntipāramitā);this path can not be repulsed (
avivārya) because of the perfection of vigour (vīryapāramitā);this path is free from any impurity (sarvarajavigata) beca
use of the perfection of meditation (dhyānapāramitā);this path leads to the sameness of open space (gaganasamatā) becaus
e of the perfection of insight (prajñāpāramitā);this path is in accordance with knowledge (jñānānugamana) since it is wi
thout conceit (nirmānatā);this path is in accordance with cultivating all qualities of the buddha (sarvadharmaparibhāvan
a) since all good qualities are fully accomplished (sarvakuśaladharmasamudānīta).this path is in accordance with one who
turns the wheel of the dharma (dharmacakrapravartanānugamana) since it keeps what has been taught before (pūrvāvisaṃvād
anatā).Since those are the pure supramunane path of the bodhisatvas, son of good family, having been established in this
pure path, the bodhisatva, wearing the great armour (mahāsaṃnāha), rides in this great vehicle (mahāyāna) and proceeds 
to the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa).
