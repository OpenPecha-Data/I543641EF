Son of good family, the patience of the bodhisatva becomes like the expanse of the sky when he is endowed with the four d
harmas. What are those four? (caturbhir dharmaiḥ kulaputra samanvāgatasya bodhisatvasya kṣāntir gaganasamā bhavati | kat
ame catvāraḥ)a) never responding to abuse with more abuse because the speech is like empty space (ākruṣṭo na pratyākrośa
tivāco gaganasamatvāt);b) never responding to beatings with more beatings because the body is like empty space (tāḍito n
a pratitāḍayati kāyasya gaganasamatvāt);c) never responding to insults with more insults because the thought is like emp
ty space (paribhāṣito na pratiparibhāṣayati cittasya gaganasamatvāt);d) never responding to anger with more anger becaus
e the intention is like empty space (roṣito na pratiroṣayati āśayasya gaganasamatvāt);When he is endowed with those four
dharmas, son of good family, the patience of the bodhisatvas becomes like empty space (caturbhir dharmaiḥ kulaputra sam
anvāgatasya bodhisatvasya kṣāntiṃ gaganasamaṃ bhavati).
