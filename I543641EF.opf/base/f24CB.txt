22. DharmanayaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva enter into the profound guiding principle of the dharma (
gambhīradharmanayapraveśa) which is difficult for disciples and isolated buddhas (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddha) to underst
and (prativedhya)?What is called ‘profound (gambhīra),’ son of good family, is the dependent origination (pratītyasamutp
āda).The way of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādanaya) is like this: formative factors are caused by ignorance; c
onsciousness is caused by formative factors; name and form are caused by consciousness; the six fields of sense-percepti
on is caused by name and form; touch is caused by the six fields of sense-perception; feeling is caused by touch; thirst
is caused by feeling; grasping is caused by thirst; existence is caused by grasping; birth is caused by existence; agei
ng and death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, depression, and despair are caused by birth. Thus this great mass of utter
suffering originates.(yad uta avidyāpratyayā saṃskārāḥ saṃskārapratyayaṃ vijñānaṃ vijñānapratyayan nāmarūpan nāmarūpapr

eśa) of living beings, in which the bodhisatva enters with knowledge, this is called the guiding principle of the origin
of the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādasamudayanaya).What then is the guiding principle of the cessation of the
dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādanirodhanaya)?To wit, cessation of formative factors is caused by cessation of i
gnorance comes; cessation of consciousness is caused by cessation of formative factors; cessation of name and form is ca
used by cessation of consciousness; cessation of the six fields of sense-perception is caused by cessation of name and f
orm; cessation of touch is caused by cessation of the six fields of sense-perception; cessation of feeling is caused by 
cessation of touch; cessation of thirst is caused by cessation of feeling; cessation of grasping is caused by cessation 
of thirst; cessation of existence is caused by cessation of grasping; cessation of birth is caused by cessation of exist
ence comes; cessation of ageing, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, depression and despair is caused by cessation of
birth. Thus this great mass of utter suffering ceases.(yad uta avidyānirodhāt saṃskāranirodhaḥ, saṃskāranirodhād vijñān

to duḥkhaskandhasya nirodho bhavati)This, son of good family, is the guiding principle of dependent origination ceasing 
(pratītyasamutpādanirodhanaya).What are the causes and conditions (hetupratyaya) for the purification (vyavadāna) of liv
ing beings, in which the bodhisatva enters with knowledge, though any disciple or isolated buddha [cannot enter], this i
s called the entrance into the profound guiding principle of dharma.Why is that? Because both the vices of all living be
ings and the knowledge of purification (sarvasatvakleśavyavadānajñāna) belong to the sphere of the Awakened Lords (buddh
agacara),and the bodhisatva understands these connetions (anusaṃdhi) by his own knowledge (ātmajñāna) and the presence o
f the Buddhas (buddhādhiṣṭhāna).Further, what we called ‘profound (gambhīra)’ is concerned with essential entities (satk
āya).As the self is pure (ātmaviśuddhi), thus all dharmas are pure (sarvadharmaviśuddhi).Why? If you really search for e
ssential entities (satkāya), they can never be grasped (nopalabhyante).That which can never be grasped is ‘profound (gam
bhīra).’The self has never been grasped by any buddha.Why is that?The self is originally pure (ādiviśuddha), and just as
the self is pure, so all dharmas are pure.Why do we say ‘pure (viśuddha)’?Since any dharma is unoriginated (anutpanna) 
and beyond origination (anutpāda), not ceased (aniruddha), and beyond cessation (anirodha), it is called ‘pure (viśuddha
).’In what is beyond darkness (andhakāra), beyond manifestation (anābhāsa), without basis (anālaya) and blindness (timir
a), in what is the deep and highest truth (gaṃbhīraparamārtha), there is no sight (cakṣur) or cessation of sight, up to 
and including no mind (manas) or cessation of mind, that is the space of objects (gocara) where there is no calculation 
(gaṇanā).That which makes the space of objects (gocara), being a space without objects, that is the highest truth (param
ārtha), and that is why it is called ‘profound (gambhīra).’Because it cannot be grasped by thought and mind (acittamanog
rāhya), it is difficult to understand (duradhigamya), difficult to see (durdṛśya), and difficult to comprehend (duḥprati
vedhya). But he, not dependent on others in respect of knowledge (jñānāparapraṇeya), still teaches this profound guiding
principle of dharma to other living beings (parasatvān gambhīradharmanayaṃ pradeśayati),This is the entrance into the p
rofound guiding principle of dharma (gambhīradharmanayapraveśa) of the bodhisatva, which is hard for disciples and isola
ted buddhas to fathom (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddhaduravagāha).
