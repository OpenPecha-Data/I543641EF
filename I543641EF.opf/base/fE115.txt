ied manner means mindfulness (smṛti) and the good conduct means non-distraction (avikṣepa).They obtain the light (āloka)
being free from darkness (andhakāra). Here, what is called the darkness is the ignorance (ajñāna) of dharmas, and what 
is called the light is the unhindered knowledge (apratihatajñāna) of dharmas, thus those are called being free from dark
ness and obtaining the light.
