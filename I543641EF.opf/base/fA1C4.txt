Son of good family, the bodhisatva transcends the Māra inherent in the parts of personality (skandhamārasamatikrānta) by 
knowing and understanding the fact that all dharmas are just like an illusion (sarvadharmamāyopama);he transcends the Mā
ra of vices (kleśamārasamatikrānta) by correctly understanding in accordance with tradition (yathāśrutadharmeṣu yoniśaḥ 
prativedhana);he transcends the Māra of death (mṛtyumārasamatikrānta) by understanding the dependent origination (pratīt
yasamutpādaprativedhana);he transcends the Māra of the sons of gods (devaputramārasamatikrānta) by not forgetting the th
ought of awakening (bodhicittāsaṃpramoṣa).
