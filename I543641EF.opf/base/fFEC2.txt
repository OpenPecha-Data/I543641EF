If, Lord, the Tathāgata gives (pravārayatu) some advice (kathā) about the entrance into the analysis of the dharma (dharm
aviniścaya) to me, I would ask a question.Why is that (tat kasya hetoḥ)? The Lord, having obtained the knowledge of non-
attachment (asaṅga), is skilled in knowing the excellent and not so excellent abilities in all living beings (sarvasatva
varāvarendriyajñānakuśala);The Lord, having obtained the light, is free from the all darkness (sarvāndhakāravigata);The 
Lord, having known the meaning (arthajña), is skilled in the knowledge of the division of words (padaprabhedajñāna);The 
Lord, having known the proper time (kālajña), is always free of faulty prophecy (akṣūṇavyākaraṇa);The Lord, having known
the proper measure (mātrakāla), teaches religion accordingly to each individual (yathāpratyarhadharmadeśaka) of all liv
ing being;The Lord, having played with (vikrīḍita) the supernormal knowledges (abhijñā), is skilled in the knowledge of 
ascertainment (viniścaya) of the base of magic (ṛddhipāda);The Lord, having been endowed with the understanding of obser
vation (vyavalokanabuddhimat), throughly shows (ādarśita) the mental behavior of all living beings (sarvasatvacittacarit
a) as he places it upon the palm of his hand (karatale);Since the Lord has been elevated above (abhyudgata), nobody can 
look at the top of his head (anavalokitamūrdhatā);The Lord, having been unsurpassed (anabhibhūta), became a hero in the 
great three-thousand thousands of worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu);The Lord, having awakened through his own powe
r (svayaṃbhū), entered into the state of perfect awakening (abhisaṃbuddha) by himself (svayam) to the all moments of exi
stence without a teacher (anācāryakam);The Lord is the leader (nāyaka), and teaches the right way (samyagmārgadeśika) to
those on bad ways (kumārgapratipanneṣu) without any leader (anāyaka);The Lord, having become the king of doctors (vaidy
arāja), establishes (pratiṣṭhāpayati) the way into the state without disease (vyādhi) or death (maraṇa) for [living bein
gs] who are involved with this world (lokasanniveśa) covered with desire, defilement, and obstruction (āvaraṇa) from beg
inningless until endless time (anavarāgra);The Lord, having had power and vitality (sthāmaparākrama), is skilled in the 
knowledge if what is proper and what is improper (sthānāsthānajñānakuśala), and has obtained the three knowledges (trivi
dya);The Lord has obtained intrepidities (vaiśāradya), extinguished contamination (āsravakṣaya), was perfectly awakened 
to (abhisaṃbuddha) sameness (samatā), is skilled in the knowledge of purification (vyavadāna) without affliction (asaṃkl
iṣṭa), and roars the best of lions’ roar (siṃharṣabhanādanādi) to all of the world including the gods;The Lord, having b
een endowed with the eighteen special qualities of the Buddha (āveṇikabuddhadharmasamanvāgata), has the unattached knowl
edge (asaṅgajñāna) of the three times (trikāla);The Lord, having purified his body, speech, and mind (kāyavakcittapariśu
ddhi), has neither error (skhalita) nor rough speech (ravita), and sees every concentration (samāpatti) and the knowledg
e of liberation (vimuktijñānadarśana);The Lord, who lives with great friendliness (mahāmaitrī), has a mind without hosti
le intent (apratihata) and same thoughts towards all living beings (samacittatā sarvasatveṣu) because he is endowed with
the [divine] sight (cakṣur) which is to see with the light of the same nature as empty space (gaganasama);The Lord, who
is established in great compassion (mahākaruṇā), is not shaken by good, evil, pain, or pleasure (sukṛtaduṣkṛtasukhaduḥk
ha) of living beings because he is endowed with the mind which is the entrance into the sameness (samatā);The Lord, who 
is equal to all the buddhas (sarvabuddhasama), enters into the non-duality which is the knowing of the equality (dvayasa
matājñānapraviṣṭa);The Lord, who is without distinction (nirviśeṣa), practices (prayoga) sameness (samatā) of all living
beings since he is purified (suviśuddha) just like empty space;The Lord is free from desire, is satisfied with insight 
(prajñatṛpta), and free from gain, honor and fame (lābhasatkāraśloka);The Lord is omniscient (sarvajña), and his mode of
five eyes (pañcacakṣur) is purified (pariśuddhi) and sees everything;I, having known that the Lord is endowed with such
immeasurable virtues, religion, and knowledge of the tathāgata (apramāṇatathāgataguṇadharmajñāna), have a high regard f
or them, and wish to respectfully (sagaurava) ask you the entrance into the explaining of religion (dharmaprabhāvanaprav
eśa).Living beings should practice the religion without pride (nirmāṇatā), and ask the Tathāgata for the sake of desire 
to realize the religion by the knowledge of omniscience (sarvajñajñānābhinirhāra).This had been said, the Lord said this
to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (evam ukte bhagavān gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvaṃ mahāsatvam etad avocat):“Go
od, good (sādhu sādhu), son of good family (kulaputra). You asked so many Awakened Lords as numerous as the grains of sa
nd in the river Gaṅgā (aṅgānadīvālikāsama) and attained the prophecy of awakening (vyākaraṇalābha). Son of good family, 
ask the Tathāgata whatever you may wish. I will satisfy your mind (cittam ārādhayiṣyāmi) by prophecy.”Then the bodhisatv
a, the great being named Guṇarājaprabhāsa joined this assembly, was seated with them, , and said this to the bodhisatva,
the great being Gaganagañja (atha khalu guṇarājaprabhāso nāma bodhisatvo mahāsatvo tatraiva pariṣadi sannipatito ’bhūt 
sanniṣaṇṇo gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvaṃ etad avocat).“Son of good family, why do you wish to pose a question to the Tathāgat
a?” Then again, the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja uttered these verses to that bodhisatva, the great being Guṇ
arājaprabhāsa.
