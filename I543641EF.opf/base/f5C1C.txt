Son of good family, these are eight pure vigours of bodhisatvas. What are the eight?a) vigour to adorn his body (kāyālaṃk
āra) but the body is not the objective support since it is distinguished (vikalpita) as a reflection (pratibimba);b) vig
our to accomplish proper speech (vāgabhisaṃskāra) although the speech cannot be perceived since it is distinguished as v
oidness (vaśika);c) vigour to put the thought (citta) into the state of concentration (samādhi) although the thought is 
not the objective support since it is imagined by the true state of thought (cittadharmatā);d) vigour to attain all aspe
cts of perfection (pāramitā) although they cannot be perceived since they are imagined by the true nature of dharma (dha
rmatā) which is the extinction of the continuous succession of thought (cittaparaṃparā);e) vigour to attain all dharmas 
that are wings of awakening (sarvabodhipakṣyadharmasamudgama) although the awakening is not perceived (na samanupaś-) si
nce it is distinguished as the essential character (bhāvalakṣaṇa);f) vigour to purify Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra) altho
ugh the fields are not perceived since they are distinguished as empty space;g) vigour to retain all learning (sarvaśrut
adhāraṇa) while regarding (samanupaśyat) the sound (śabda) as an echo (pratiśrutkā);h) vigour to accomplish all qualitie
s of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharma) although they are not the objective support since they are distinguished as the homo
geneity of absolute reality (dharmadhātvasaṃbheda) by nature (lakṣaṇa);Son of good family, those eight are the pure vigo
urs of the bodhisatvas.
