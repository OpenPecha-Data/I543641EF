Just as empty space is immaterial (adṛśya) and develops all beings, in the same way, the vigour of the bodhisatvas is not
established in any dharma and brings all beings to maturity (sarvasatvān paripācayati).Just as empty space opens up a p
ossibility for all beings (sarvasatvāvakāśa) being placed in open space (ābhyavakāśika), in such a way, the vigour of th
e bodhisatvas opens a possibility for all living beings, being free from viewpoints (sarvadṛṣṭivigata) to all beings.Jus
t as empty space raises herbs, trees, and crops (tṛṇavanaspatisaysa) without root and basis, in the same way, the vigour
of the bodhisatvas generates the qualities of the Buddha (buddhadharma), not being established in the root view that th
e transitory collection [is a real self] (satkāyadṛṣṭimūla).Just as empty space is all-pervasive (sarvatrānugatā) while 
there is no transmigration of nature (asaṃkrāntilakṣaṇa), in the same way, the vigour of the bodhisatva is in accordance
with all good qualities (sarvākuśaladharmānugata) while there is no transmigration of nature.Just as empty space is uni
ted in the sameness while it displays different figures, in the same way, the vigour of the bodhisatvas is connected wit
h the sameness of all qualities for all living beings while it shows in different kinds of deeds.The bodhisatva sees cle
arly the sameness of different kinds of accomplishments (sādhaka) and he does not hold it in his mind, even though he ha
s undertaken [the practice of vigour]. In such a way, the vigour of the bodhisatva becomes like empty space.
