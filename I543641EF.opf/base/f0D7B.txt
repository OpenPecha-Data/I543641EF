32. SatvopajīvyaHow then, son of good family, the bodhisatva, having accumulated immeasurable merits (aprameyapuṇyopacaya
), nourishes all living beings (satvopajīvya)?.Son of good family, the bodhisatva practices friendliness (matrī) to all 
living beings;he practices compassion (karuṇā) to all creatures;he is not attached to anything in particular in his medi
tations (dhyāneṣu atanmayavihāritā);he gives away all his possessions to beggars (yācanakeṣu sarvasvaparityāgatā);his pl
easure is imperishable (akṣayabhoga) through his merits (puṇya);he is always committed to his intension (āśaya) by the p
urity of morality (śīlapariśuddhi);his thoughts are like an earth (pṛthivīsama) since there is no high or low (natonnata
) in his mind;he is free from thoughts by pure morality (śīlapariśuddhi);his thought is liberated (cittamukta) and the g
ate is free from hinderance (mukhānāvṛta) by accomplishing all sacrifices (sarvayajñapratipatti);he has perfected memory
and eloquence (dhāraṇīpratibhānasaṃpanna) by investigating the dharma (dharmapravicaya);he depends on the knowledge of 
supernatural powers (abhijñājñānāśrita) by going to immeasurable Buddha-fields (aprameyabuddhakṣetragamana);[he thinks:]
‘Just as the four main elements (cāturmahābhautika) in the external world nourish all living beings (satvaupajīvya), ma
y the four main elements belonging to me nourish all living beings!May there be in me no root of good connecting with th
e efficiency in knowledge of the dharma that does not support all living beings (mā bhūt tan mama kuśalamūlaṃ dharmajñān
akauśalyam vā yan na sarvvasatvopajīvyaṃ syād)! Thus the roots of good will be transformed by me.’Quotation from ŚikṣMS 
22b3; B 33,11-12; ŚikṣTib(D) 24b1; ŚikṣChi(T.1636) 82b5-7.ŚikṣMS: āryagaganagañjasūtre ’py āha mā bhūt tan mama kuśalamū

merits, nourishes all living beings.
