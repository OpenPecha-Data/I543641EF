To wit, a) the perfection of insight (prajñāpāramitā) as the summit (mūrdhan) of all perfections (sarvapāramitā);b) the s
upernormal knowledge without retrogression [as the summit] of all supernormal knowledges (sarvābhijñā);c) the stage of c
onsecration (abhiṣekabhūmi) [as the summit] of all stages (sarvabhūmi);d) the right view (samyagdṛṣṭi) and concentration
(samādhi) without retrogression [as the summit] all wings of awakening (sarvabodhipakṣikadharma);e) the meaning and elo
quence without obstruction (anācchedyārthapratibhāna) [as the summit] of special knowledges (pratisaṃvid);f) the way int
o unattached knowledge (asaṅgajñānapraveśa) [as the summit] of all knowledges (sarvajñāna);g) the knowledge of understan
ding superior, mediocre, and inferior (hīnamadhyaviśiṣṭapraveśajñāna) [as the summit] of all his faculties (sarvendriya)
;h) following the knowledge of light (ābhāsajñānānugamana) [as the summit] of power and fearlessness (balavaiśāradya);i)
the sight of the Buddha (buddhacakṣur), seeing all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharma) as being in the palm of 
his hand (karatalagata), [as the summit] of all kinds of sights (sarvacakṣur);j) the perfect awakening (abhisaṃbodhi) th
rough insight (prajñā) associated with a moment of thought (ekacittakṣaṇasamāyukta) [as the summit] after sitting on the
place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍaniṣadana) - they recollect such ten qualities as the summit.This recollection is not dist
urbed by any particular viewpoint (dṛṣṭi), manifestations of bad dispositions (anuśayaparyutthāna), mental efforts (mana
sikāra), or discursive thinking (prapañca), so there is no impurity (anāvila) and thus the recollection of gods is, son 
of good family, called the recollection of gods, which is authorized by the Lord.

15. BodhisatvacaryāHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva perform his practice of a bodhisatva (bodhisatvacary
ā) after having obtained the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatā)?The extinction (nirvāṇa) is the pacification of all 
vices (sarvakleśapraśamana),the allaying of every feeling (sarvavedanāpratipraśrambhaṇa),the pacification of all objects
(sarvālambanapraśamana),and no connection (pratisaṃdhi) with the parts of personality, spheres or fields of perception 
(skandhadhātvāyatana).Thus the good man (satpuruṣa), having obtained the sameness of extiction (nirvāṇasamatā), playfull
y employs (vikrīḍita) the great compassion (mahākaruṇā), means and insight (prajñopāya), and knowledge (jñāna) of the fo
rmer lives (pūrvanivāsa);he is sustained by the presence of the Buddhas (buddhādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhitai);he cultivates insigh
t (prajñā) and knowledge (jñāna);he purifies cultivation (bhavānā) by means of the clear presence of manifestation (bhāv
ānapariśuddhi);he depends on concentration (samādhi) which is the miraculous play (vikrīḍita) with illusion (māyā);The v
ices by which he might produce existence and bonds of existence, these he does away with (yaiḥ kleśaḥ saṃsāraṃ saṃsāraba
ndhanaṃ vā prabhāvayati tān prajahāti), and the knowledge by means of which he teaches extinction, in that he excels (ye
na jñānena nirvāṇaṃ deśayati tatra vaśitāprāptaḥ), thus he is born from non-existence and originated form non-originatio
n (anutpādotpanno ’bhūtabhūtaḥ).Even though he is established in the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatāsaṃprasthita),
he still does not interrupt bringing living beings to maturity (satvaparipāka).This, son of good family, is the gate of
knowledge (jñānamukha), called the development of two approaches (yamakapariṇāma), [namely the great compassion (mahākā
ruṇā) and expedient means (upāya)] of the bodhisatvas, and even though the bodhisatva is placed in the gate of knowledge
after having obtained the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatā), he still performs the practice of a bodhisatva (bodhi
satvacaryā).

16. CaritalakṣaṇaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva know1 the essential character of behaviour of all livi
ng beings (sarvasatvacaritalakṣaṇa)?There, son of good family, are eighty-four thousand kinds of behaviour of living bei
ngs (caturaśītisatvacaritasahasra), and these are the basic words of a summary (mūloddānapada).The behaviour of all livi
ng beings, which is immeasureable (sarvasatvacaritāpramāṇa), unthinkable (acintya), and ineffable (anabhilāpya), is know
n by the knowledge of a Buddha (buddhajñāna), but not by the knowledge of the disciples, the isolated buddhas (śrāvakapr
atyekabuddhajñāna), or the knowledge of bodhisatva (bodhisatvajñāna).Thus the bodhisatva penetrates the essential charac
ter of behaviour of all living beings (sarvasatvacaritalakṣaṇānupraveśa) through the presence of the Buddhas (buddhādhiṣ
ṭhāna) and his own knowledge (ātmajñāna).The behaviour’s essence (svabhāva), essential character (lakṣaṇa), the essentia
l character of cause (hetulakṣaṇa), the essential character of condition (pratyayalakṣaṇa), the essential character of p
roductive cause (karaṇahetulakṣaṇa), the essential character of combination (sāmagrīlakṣaṇa), the essential character of
difference (nānātvalakṣaṇa), the essential character of discordance (vilakṣaṇa), the essential character of passion (rā
galakṣaṇa), the essential character of aversion (dveṣalakṣaṇa), the essential character of delusion (mohalakṣaṇa), the e
ssential character of the three together (sabhāgalakṣaṇa), the essential character of hell-beings (nirayalakṣaṇa), the a
nimal world (tiryagyonilakṣaṇa), the essential character of the world of the lord of death (yamalokalakṣaṇa), the essent
ial character of gods (devalakṣaṇa), the essential character of human being (manuṣyalakṣaṇa), the essential character of
the entrance into the fixed course of disciples (śrāvakaniyāmāvakranti), the essential character of the entrance into t
he fixed course of isolated buddhas (pratyekabuddhaniyāmalakṣaṇa), the essential character of the entrance into the fixe
d course of the buddhas (buddhaniyāmalakṣaṇa), the essential character of distant cause, the essential character of inte
rmediate cause (anantaryalakṣaṇa), and the essential character of immediate cause - he knows all the essential character
s of behaviour truly as they are (yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti), and there is no fault at all (anavadya) in his understanding (
sarvajñāna).

17. DharmaratnanidhānaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva grasp the treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmarat
nanidhāna) of the Awakened Lords?Son of good family, the treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) of the Awaken
ed Lords is imperishable (akṣaya).Thus, as many as are the entrances into the essential character of behaviour in all li
ving beings, so many are the entrances into knowledge which is the gate into the treasury of the Dharma Jewel of the Awa
kened Lords (yāvantaḥ sarvasatvānāṃ caritalakṣaṇānupraveśās tāvad api buddhānāṃ bhagavatāṃ dharmaratnanidhānamukhajñānap
raveśāḥ).Just as the behaviour of living beings is imperishable and endless, in the same way, the treasury of the Dharma
Jewel of the Awakened Lords is also imperishable and endless (yathā satvacaritam akṣayam anatam evam api buddhānāṃ bhag
avatāṃ dharmaratnanidhānāny akṣayāṇi anatāni).From the night (rātri) when the Tathāgata attained awakening (bodhiprāpta)
to the night of his extinction (parinirvāṇa), the treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) has been explained,
is being explained, and will be explained by the Tathāgata. All of them are what they really are (tathatā), not differe
nt from what they are (avitathatā), and nothing else but what they are (ananyathā).Why is it called ‘such’ (kasmāt tathe
ti)? Since it is the entrance into the peace of suchness, it is called 'such’ (tathatāśāntisaṃprasthitatvāt tatheti).Why
is it called ‘suchness without error’ (kasmāt avitatheti)? Since it is the entrance into the highest truth, it is calle
d ‘suchness without error.’ (paramārthasatyasaṃprasthitatvāt tatheti)Why is it called ‘suchness that is not other’ (kasm
āt ananyatatheti)? Since he seeks nothing else but the essential nature (svabhāva), there is no other.Further, as for th
e treasury of the Dharma Jewels of the Awakened Lords, even though living beings of a system of threefold thousand great
thousand worlds (trisāhasramahāsahasralokadhātuparyāpanna) were as learned as (bāhuśruta) Ānanda, all of them would not
be able to understand even a syllable (akṣara) in hundreds of thousands of millions of aeons (kalpakoṭīśatasahasra); an
d further they would not be able to teach even a single meaning (ekārtha) - such a true teaching (yathābhūtadeśanā) is t
he treasury of Dharma Jewels belonging to the Awakened Lords.The bodhisatvas, having grasped it, do not forget (saṃpramo
ṣayati) any letter or lose any meaning (artha), and they please (ārādhyati) all living beings, gratify (ārāgayati) all t
he Buddhas, vanquish all the Evil Ones (sarvamāra), subjugate all other heretics (sarvānyatīrthika), and appease all vic
es (sarvakleśa). Thus they understand the Dharma Jewel Words.In this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva grasps the 
treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) of the Awakened Lords.

18. DharmasvabhāvaBut further, son of good family, in the perspective of the essential character of the dharma (dharmasva
bhāva), the bodhisatva may grasp an essential character, thinking: “I have fully understood (abhisambuddha) the dharmas.
”But, how then has the Tathāgata understood (abhisaṃbuddha) the dharmas?[It is like this:] their nature is [like] illusi
on (māyāsvabhāva) because it is not established in reality (apariniṣpanna);their nature is [like] a dream (svapna) becau
se it transcends perceptual fields (viṣayātikrantatarayogena);their nature is [like] a mirage (marīci) because there is 
no birth (atyantānutpanna);their nature is [like] a reflected image (pratibhāsa) because it is unchanging (asaṃkrānti);t
heir nature is [like] a reflection (pratibimba) because it is devoid of intrinsic nature (niḥsvabhāva);their nature is e
mpty (sūnya) because it is dependent (aparādhīna);their nature is without distinguishing mark (animitta) because it is b
eyond thought-constructions (nirvikalpa);their nature is wishless (apraṇihita) because it is not attached to thoughts (c
ittāsaṅga);their nature has no desire (rāga) because it is free from all desires (sarvarāgavigata);their nature is uncon
ditioned (asaṃskṛta) because there is no any calculation (asaṃkhya).Thus, son of good family, based on the information (
prajñapti) in conventional expressions (vyavahāra) of others I was fully awakened (abhisaṃbuddha) to such dharmas,but st
ill, their essential character (dharmasvabhāvalakṣaṇa) is inexpressible in words.Even though the bodhisattva, who wishes
to grasp the dharmas, is fully awakened to dharmas with such an essential character, he still teaches other beings (par
asatvapudgala) by means of syllables and explanations of language (akṣaranirukti).

19. SatvādiviśuddhiHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva bring all living beings to maturity (paripācayati) g
iven the fact that they are originally pure (satvādiviśuddhi).The realm of living beings (satvadhātu), son of good famil
y, is originally pure (ādiviśuddhi), and thus their roots have no basis (avastuka).The bodhisatva, son of good family, h
aving understood that the roots of all dharmas are completely cut off, brings living beings to maturity, and then he doe
s not hold the view of a self (ātmadṛṣṭi), the view of a living being (satvadṛṣṭi), the view of a life principle (jīvadṛ
ṣṭi), or the view of a person (pudgaladṛṣṭi).Again he thinks (punas tasyaivaṃ bhavati): “what is called ‘living being (s
atva)’ is a misunderstanding (viparyasta). Because of being occupied (paryavasthāna) with the view of cause (hetudṛṣṭi),
ignorance (avidyā), existence (bhāva), thirst (tṛṣṇā), and unreal mental constructions (abhūtaparikalpa), it is called 
‘living being.’”But the bodhisatva still teaches the Dharma (dharmaṃ deśayati) to living beings in order to get rid of v
ices which originate from misunderstanding (viparyāsasamutthitakleśaprahāṇa), and he does not forget (na vipraṇāśayati) 
substances (bhāva).Since he is devoid of a living being (niḥsatva), and detached from a living being (satvaviveka), he b
rings living beings to maturity.Thus the bodhisatva brings living beings to maturity (sarvasatvān paripācayati) by the o
riginal purity (ādiviśuddhi).

20. DharmaprayogaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva collect all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharma
samudānaya) by thorough practice (yoniśaḥprayoga)?‘Thorough (yoniśaḥ)’ means the entrance into dependent origination (pr
atītyasamutpādapraveśa). Why is that?As is the cause and conditions (hetupratyaya), thus the fruit (phala) is produced (
abhinirvṛtta).The generosity (dāna) is the cause of great comforts (mahābhogahetu),and the bodhisatva, having transferre
d that giving into omniscience (tyāgaṃ sarvajñatāyaṃ pariṇāmaitvā), fulfils the perfection of giving (dānapāramitāṃ pari
pūrayati).The morality (śīla) is the cause of birth among gods and men (devamānuṣajātihetu),and the bodhisatva, being bo
rn among gods and men, makes living beings adopt moral ways (śīlam avatārayati);he, having transferred the maintaining m
orality into omniscience, fulfils the perfection of morality (śīlapāramitāṃ paripūrayati).The tolerance and mildness (kṣ
āntisauratya) are the causes which are the ornaments of body, speech and thought (kāyavākcittālaṃkārahetu);the bodhisatv
a practices what is good for oneself and for others (ātmaparahita) through the ornaments of body, speech and thought (kā
yavākcittālaṃkāra);he, having transferred the basis of wishing to help and tolerance into omniscience (hitakāmakṣāntyava
sthāṃ sarvajñatāyaṃ pariṇāmaitvā), fulfils the perfection of tolerance (kṣāntipāramitāṃ paripūrayati).The vigour (vīrya)
is the cause of collecting all Buddha learning (sarvabuddhaśruta);The bodhisatva makes an effort (vīryam ārambya), atta
ins all roots of good (kuśalamūlaṃ samādāpya), transfers the vigour of attaining all roots of good into omniscience, and
fulfils the perfection of vigour (vīryapāramitāṃ paripūrayati).The meditation (dhyāna) is the cause of happiness and no
ble birth (pramuditacittājāneyahetu);the bodhisatva completes the accumulations for peaceful meditation (śamathasaṃbhāra
) with happiness and noble birth (pramuditacittājāneya);he, having transferred the accumulations of peaceful meditation 
(śamathasaṃbhāra) into omniscience, fulfils the perfection of meditation (dhyānapāramitāṃ paripūrayati).Learning (śruta)
is the cause of great insight (mahāprājñahetu);the bodhisatva, not being entangled in the preconceived viewpoints (upal
aṃbhadṛṣṭikāgrahaṇa), having transferred the learning without apprehending (anupalambhaśruta) into omniscience, fulfils 
the perfection of insight (prajñāpāramitāṃ paripūrayati).In the same way with all good qualities (sarvakuśaladharma), wh
atever the cause of good qualities (kuśaladharmahetu) accumulated, its effect (phala) will appear without effort (anābho
ga).Further, the cause and conditions (hetupratyaya) are called thorough mental effort (yoniśomanasikāra).With regard to
what is called ‘thorough (yoniśaḥ)’, there is the self in every fundamental moment of existence.Just as there is no sel
f in oneself, so there is no self in any moment of existence.Just as the self is empty (śūnya), so all moments of existe
nce are empty.Just as the self is merely a word (nāma), so all moments of existence are merely words.Thus the thorough p
ractice (yoniśaḥprayoga) of the bodhisatva is to be equally associated with all moments of existence.That which is the s
ame as all moments of existence (sarvadharmasamatā) is the same as all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharmasamatā)
, and thus the thorough practice of the bodhisatva is to attain the qualities of the Buddha (buddhadharma).

21. AcyutābhijñāHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva never lose his supernormal knowledge (acyutābhijñā) aft
er having attained the mastery of all dharmas (sarvadharmādhipatya)?Son of good family, if a certain ascetic or a brahmi
n (kulaputraśramaṇabrāhmaṇa) produces the supernormal knowledge (abhijñā) without having overcome the view that there is
a permanent substance (satkāyadṛṣṭi), he will loose his supernormal knowledge.However the bodhisatva, having overcome s
ixty-two doctrinal viewpoints (dvāṣaṣṭidṛṣṭigata) derived from the root view that there is a permanent substance (satkāy
adṛṣṭimūla), produces the supernormal knowledge in the absence of any attachment of view;he is endowed with knowledge (j
ñānavān), insight (prajñāvān), consciousness (buddhivān), tolerance (kṣāntivān), morality (śīlavān);he, having entered i
nto concentration, is detached from body and mind (kāyacittavivikta);he approaches his inner and does not move around hi
s outer through such knowledge (jñāna);he is endowed with the object that there is no object;he is endowed with discipli
ned thoughts (ājāneyacitta) and joyous thoughts;he examines [things] by means of thorough examination (suniścita);he has
supremely pure consciousness which is not disturbed by vices (kleśa), having attained the light (ālokalabdha).there is 
no obstruction (vitimira) in his knowledge (jñāna);he accumulates merits (puṇyasaṃbhāropacaya);he accumulates knowledge 
(jñānasaṃbhāropacaya);he accumulates peaceful meditation (śamathasaṃbhāropacaya);he accumulates expanded vision (vipaśya
nasaṃbhāropacaya);he is stabilized by his generosity (dāna);he is adorned with morality (śīlālaṃkṛta);he is clad in the 
armor of tolerance (kṣāntisaṃnāha);he is equipped with the mail of effort (vīrya);he is established in meditation (dhyān
apratiṣṭhita);he is endowed with the consciousness that cultivates insight (prajñāsubhāvita);he is in accordance with fr
iendliness (maitrī);he is established in compassion (karuṇāpratiṣṭhita);he has realized through skillful means (upāyābhi
nirhṛta);he produces the supernormal knowledge (abhijñā) because he is endowed with such a dharma;he, having been elevat
ed into the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa) by the supernormal knowledges, attains the mastery of all dharmas (sarvadhar
mādhipatya) by the supernormal knowledges;he, having seen all forms (sarvarūpadarśana), having heard all words (sarvaśab
daśravaṇa), and having entered into the whole thought (sarvacittapraveśa), recollects innumerable aeons (asaṃkhyeyakalpa
);having obtained miracle (vikurvaṇa) which is the cessation of the sullied states (āsravakṣaya) through all his magical
powers (sarvarddhi), he attains the mastery of all considerations (vyavacāra) with discrimination (vikalpa) as much as 
there is the discrimination of mind (manas);and thus, according to the all dharmas, he is established in non-effort (anā
bhoga).In that way, son of good family, the bodhisatva never turns back from his supernormal knowledges (acyutābhijñā) c
ontrols all dharmas (sarvadharmādhipatya).

22. DharmanayaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva enter into the profound guiding principle of the dharma (
gambhīradharmanayapraveśa) which is difficult for disciples and isolated buddhas (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddha) to underst
and (prativedhya)?What is called ‘profound (gambhīra),’ son of good family, is the dependent origination (pratītyasamutp
āda).The way of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādanaya) is like this: formative factors are caused by ignorance; c
onsciousness is caused by formative factors; name and form are caused by consciousness; the six fields of sense-percepti
on is caused by name and form; touch is caused by the six fields of sense-perception; feeling is caused by touch; thirst
is caused by feeling; grasping is caused by thirst; existence is caused by grasping; birth is caused by existence; agei
ng and death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, depression, and despair are caused by birth. Thus this great mass of utter
suffering originates.(yad uta avidyāpratyayā saṃskārāḥ saṃskārapratyayaṃ vijñānaṃ vijñānapratyayan nāmarūpan nāmarūpapr

evalasya mahato duḥkhaskandhasya samudayo bhavati)What are the causes and conditions (hetupratyaya) for the vices (saṃkl
eśa) of living beings, in which the bodhisatva enters with knowledge, this is called the guiding principle of the origin
of the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādasamudayanaya).What then is the guiding principle of the cessation of the
dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādanirodhanaya)?To wit, cessation of formative factors is caused by cessation of i
gnorance comes; cessation of consciousness is caused by cessation of formative factors; cessation of name and form is ca
used by cessation of consciousness; cessation of the six fields of sense-perception is caused by cessation of name and f
orm; cessation of touch is caused by cessation of the six fields of sense-perception; cessation of feeling is caused by 
cessation of touch; cessation of thirst is caused by cessation of feeling; cessation of grasping is caused by cessation 
of thirst; cessation of existence is caused by cessation of grasping; cessation of birth is caused by cessation of exist
ence comes; cessation of ageing, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, depression and despair is caused by cessation of
birth. Thus this great mass of utter suffering ceases.(yad uta avidyānirodhāt saṃskāranirodhaḥ, saṃskāranirodhād vijñān

to duḥkhaskandhasya nirodho bhavati)This, son of good family, is the guiding principle of dependent origination ceasing 
(pratītyasamutpādanirodhanaya).What are the causes and conditions (hetupratyaya) for the purification (vyavadāna) of liv
ing beings, in which the bodhisatva enters with knowledge, though any disciple or isolated buddha [cannot enter], this i
s called the entrance into the profound guiding principle of dharma.Why is that? Because both the vices of all living be
ings and the knowledge of purification (sarvasatvakleśavyavadānajñāna) belong to the sphere of the Awakened Lords (buddh
agacara),and the bodhisatva understands these connetions (anusaṃdhi) by his own knowledge (ātmajñāna) and the presence o
f the Buddhas (buddhādhiṣṭhāna).Further, what we called ‘profound (gambhīra)’ is concerned with essential entities (satk
āya).As the self is pure (ātmaviśuddhi), thus all dharmas are pure (sarvadharmaviśuddhi).Why? If you really search for e
ssential entities (satkāya), they can never be grasped (nopalabhyante).That which can never be grasped is ‘profound (gam
bhīra).’The self has never been grasped by any buddha.Why is that?The self is originally pure (ādiviśuddha), and just as
the self is pure, so all dharmas are pure.Why do we say ‘pure (viśuddha)’?Since any dharma is unoriginated (anutpanna) 
and beyond origination (anutpāda), not ceased (aniruddha), and beyond cessation (anirodha), it is called ‘pure (viśuddha
).’In what is beyond darkness (andhakāra), beyond manifestation (anābhāsa), without basis (anālaya) and blindness (timir
a), in what is the deep and highest truth (gaṃbhīraparamārtha), there is no sight (cakṣur) or cessation of sight, up to 
and including no mind (manas) or cessation of mind, that is the space of objects (gocara) where there is no calculation 
(gaṇanā).That which makes the space of objects (gocara), being a space without objects, that is the highest truth (param
ārtha), and that is why it is called ‘profound (gambhīra).’Because it cannot be grasped by thought and mind (acittamanog
rāhya), it is difficult to understand (duradhigamya), difficult to see (durdṛśya), and difficult to comprehend (duḥprati
vedhya). But he, not dependent on others in respect of knowledge (jñānāparapraṇeya), still teaches this profound guiding
principle of dharma to other living beings (parasatvān gambhīradharmanayaṃ pradeśayati),This is the entrance into the p
rofound guiding principle of dharma (gambhīradharmanayapraveśa) of the bodhisatva, which is hard for disciples and isola
ted buddhas to fathom (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddhaduravagāha).

23. Pratītyasamutpādagaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 3Son of good family, how does the bodhisatva become skilled in knowing
the entrance into the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādapraveśajñanakuśala), and become free from two extreme vie
ws (sarvāntadvayadṛṣṭivivarjita)?.Son of good family, the bodhisatva should think like this (iha bodhisatvasyaivaṃ bhava
ti):that on which there is dependence, that is nothing in particular (yat pratītya tat kiṃcin nāsti);that on which there
is dependence, that is inexistent (yat pratītya so ’bhāvaḥ);that on which there is dependence, that is not being establ
ished in reality (yat pratītya tad apariniṣpannam);that on which there is dependent origination, that is impermanence, s
uffering, selflessness and quiescence (yat pratītyasaṃutpannaṃ tad anityaduḥkhānātmaśāntam);in the dependent origination
, there is no self, no being, no life-principle, no life-sustaining principle, no spirit, no personality, no human being
, no man (na satvajīvapoṣapuruṣapudgalamanujamānava);in the dependent origination there is no attainment (samudgama);in 
the dependent origination there is nothing, and it is effortless (avyāyāma), empty (śūnya), no distinguishing mark (anim
itta), transcendent (viveka), no activity (apracāra), no discursive thinking (aprapañca), and thus beyond discursive thi
nking (niṣprapañca).Thus origination (jāti) is just the arising of the dharma, and cessation (nirodha) is also the ceasi
ng of the dharma.Therefore it is said that there is no self, being, life-principle, life-sustaining principle, spirit, p
ersonality, human being, or man (satvajīvapoṣapuruṣapudgalamanujamānava);In the dharmas which are dependently originated
there is no true origination (jāti) and there is no owner (svāmika).Because of that, all dharmas are like grass, trees,
walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsasadṛśa).Just as there is nothing that produces external th
ings when they are originated, and there is nothing that ceases external things when they cease, just so, there is nothi
ng that produces internal things when they are originated, and there is nothing that ceases internal things when they ce
ase;But rather, when conditions (pratyaya) exist they will arise, and when conditions are completely exhausted they will
be destroyed.”If you understand this knowledge in that way, you will overcome any extreme view (sarvāntadṛṣṭi).What the
n are extreme views (antadṛṣṭi)?‘Extreme (anta)’ means discontinuity (uccheda) and continuity (nitya), and that which is
not originated and ceased is beyond discontinuity and continuity and thus pure, and therefore it is purified when conce
rned with any extreme view (sarvāntadṛṣṭi).In that way, son of good family, the bodhisatva becomes skilled in knowing th
e entrance into the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādapraveśajñanakuśala) and free from any extreme view (sarvānta
dṛṣṭi).

24. TathāgatamudrāHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva become skilled in knowing suchness without any differ
entiation (tathatāvinirbhāgajñānakuśala) as sealed with the seal of the tathāgata (tathāgatamudrāmudrita)?With regard to
what we called ‘being sealed with the seal of the tathāgata (tathāgatamudrāmudrita),’ suchness without any differentiat
ion (tathatāvinirbhāga) is the seal, and it is without distinction, activity (apravṛtti), attachment (abhiniveśa), agita
ting, or being agitated, and thus it cannot be shaken (na kampayituṃ śakyate) by the world with its gods, humans, or ant
i-gods (sadevamānuṣāsureṇa lokena).Why? The world with its gods, humans and anti-gods is indeed sealed with that seal,an
d the seal of the tathāgata is the seal which is unoriginated, empty (śūnyatā), signless (animitta), wishless (apraṇihit
a), unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), free from desire (virāga), just as it is (tathatā), the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi), and
open space (gagana).Just as the seal in the empty space (gaganamudrā) does not appear, the seal of the tathāgata does n
ot appear to even the five kinds of sight as it is sealed by the seal having its own essential character (svalakṣaṇamudr
āmudrita).All the explanations about the dharma and the pertaining conventions (dharmavyavahāra) given by the tathāgata 
are sealed with the seal of the tathāgata in that way.Among them, those which pertain to the sphere of consciousness est
ablish the dharma;but those which are not established in consciousness do not establish any dharma, and do not different
iate between any dharma;those which are sealed with the seal of the tathāgata do not differentiate suchness (tathatā).Wh
at then is the differentiation of suchness (nānātathatā)?It is those which differentiate (kalpayanti) the dharmas of sup
erior, mediocre, and inferior (hīnamadhyaviśiṣṭa),those, which do not construct any dharma and do not make any different
iation, do not differentiate suchness,and, no matter how many things are imagined and constructed (kalpitavikalpita), th
ey do not differentiate suchness.Just like all living beings wander about in empty space, the sphere of empty space (gag
anadhātu) is not connected with them, in that way, all living beings wander about in suchness, but they do not tarnish s
uchness.And here, the bodhisatva who can understand such dharmas is sealed with the seal of the tathāgata, and he does n
ot tarnish suchness.

25. DharmadhātuHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva relate to the guiding principle of the sphere of moments
of existence (dharmadhātunaya), being united with (samavasarati) the sphere of all moments of existence (sarvadharmadhā
tu)?‘The sphere of moments of existence (dharmadhātu)’ is the sphere that is free from desire since it is free from any 
impurity (rāgavigatadhātuḥ sarvarajavigatatayā?);the sphere of non-origination (anutpanna) since it is not something in 
particular (asamudānīta);the sphere without cessation (anirodha) since there is no occurrence;the sphere that does not g
o anywhere (agamanatā) since there is no transmigration (gamana);the sphere without coming (anāgamanatā) since there is 
no passing over;the sphere without abiding since there is no arising;the sphere as it really is (yathāvaddharmadhātu) be
cause of its sameness in all three times (tryadhvasamatā);the sphere of self (ātmadhātu) since it is originally pure (ād
iviśuddhi);2the sphere without personality (niḥpudgaladhātu) since it is the highest truth (paramārtha);the sphere witho
ut information (avijñāptidhātu) since it is non-abiding;the sphere without basis (anālayadhātu) since there is no contam
ination (saṃkīrṇa);the sphere without birth (anutpādadhātu) since it is fixed (niyāma);the sphere like the space (gagana
dhātu) since it is essentially tranquil (svabhāva_pariśuddhi);the sphere of liberation (nirvāṇadhātu) since there is no 
argument against it (apratipakṣa);such is the entrance into the way of the sphere of moments of existence (dharmadhātuna
yapreveśa).Since all moments of existence are like this, son of good family, if the bodhisatva enteres into the way of m
oments of existence, then, whatever he says, expresses, or teaches, all that is united with (samavasṛta) the sphere of m
oments of existence.Having entered into the way of the sphere of moments of existence, he knows the fact that there is n
o duality of the sphere of desire and the moments of existence (rāgadhātudharmadhātu)- why? - because the desire (rāga) 
has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of aversion (dveṣadhātu) and 
the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because aversion has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;th
ere is no duality of the sphere of delusion (mohadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? -because delusion 
has the nature of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of vices (kleśadhātu) and the sphere of mom
ents of existence - why? - because vices has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of
the sphere of passion (kāmadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because passion has the nature of the
sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of forms (rūpadhātu) and the sphere of moments of 
existence - why? - because forms has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sph
ere without form (ārūpyadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because the formlessness has the nature o
f the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of the eye (cakṣurdhātu) and the sphere of mo
ments of existence - why? - because the eye has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality
of the sphere of forms (rūpadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because forms has the nature of the 
sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of eye-consciousness (cakṣurvijñānadhātu) and the s
phere of moments of existence - why? - because eye-consciousness has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existenc
e;there is no duality of the sphere in the interval of mind and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because the 
sphere of mind has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of mind-consci
ousness (manovijñānadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because the sphere of mind-consciousness has 
the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of aggregates (skandhadhātu) and 
the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because the sphere of aggregates has the nature of the sphere of all moments
of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of earth, water, fire or wind (pṛthivīdhātvabdhātutejodhātuvāyudhātu) an
d the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because the earth, water, fire or wind has the nature of the sphere of all
moments of existence;there is no duality of the eighty-four thousand masses of religious teaching (caturaśītidharmaskan
dhasahasranirdeśa), the eighty-four thousand kinds of behaviour (caturaśītisahasracaritāna) or all moments of existence 
(sarvadharma) and the sphere of all moments of existence - why? - because all moments of existence have the nature of th
e sphere of all moments of existence.The bodhisatva knows all moments of existence since the moments of existence which 
is the entrance into the sameness (samatāpraveśa) is united with all moments of existence. Son of good family, this is t
he entering into the way of moments of existence of the bodhisatva.

26. DṛḍavajrāśayaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva with a resolve firm and unbrekable (dṛḍhābhedyāśaya) l
ike the diamond (yathāvajra) become well established (susthita) and unwavering (aniñjya) in this great way?Son of good f
amily, when the bodhisatva is unbreakable (abhedya) having made a resolve as firm as a diamond with the twelve qualities
, he is not disturbed by the world with its gods (sadevakena lokena). What are those twelve (katamāni dvādaśa)?To wit, a
) since the thought of awakening (bodhicitta), intention (āśaya), and determination (adhyāśaya) are unbreakable (abhedya
), the practice (prayoga) is also unbreakable;b) the generosity (dāna) is unbreakable, and the morality, tolerance, vigo
ur, meditation, and insight (dānaśīlakṣāntivīryadhyānaprajñā) are unbreakable;c) great friendliness (mahāmaitrī) and gre
at compassion (mahākaruṇa) are unbreakable;d) the way of attraction (saṃgrahavastu) is unbreakable;e) bringing living be
ings to maturity (satvaparipācana) is unbreakable;f) the purification of the Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetrapariśuddhi) is u
nbreakable;g) indefatigability in existence (saṃsārāparikheda) is unbreakable;f) non-satisfaction for the root of good (
kuśalamūlātṛpti) is unbreakable;g) endless offerings (atyantayajña) for the sake of obtaining the characteristics of a g
reat man and the marks of beauty (lakṣaṇānuvyañjana) are unbreakable;h) giving up body and life in order to uphold the t
rue religion (saddharmaparigrahāya kāyajīvitaparityāgaḥ) is unbreakable;i) dedicating his roots of good (kuśalamūlapariṇ
āmana) for the sake of other beings (parasatvapudgala) is unbreakable;j) his accumulation of all qualities of the Buddha
(sarvabuddhadharmasamudānaya) is unbreakable.When the qualities of bodhisatva are unbreakable in that way, son of good 
family, he is unbreakable having made a resolve as firm as a diamond (dṛḍhavajrāśaya).Just as a diamond (maṇiratnavajra)
breaks any kind of gem without being broken itself, so the bodhisatva, having made a resolve as firm as a diamond, remo
ves bad habits, manifestations of vices, and wrong views (anuśayakleśaparyutthānadṛṣṭigata) of all living beings, but st
ill he himself is not broken because of this great vehicle (mahāyāna).In this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva is
unbreakable having made a resolves as firm as a diamond, being well established and unshakable in this great way.

27. BuddhaviṣayaHow then, son of good family, does the own realm (svaviṣaya) of the bodhisatva become pure, when he has a
ttained the realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya)?‘The realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya)’ is not a realm, and since it is 
non-realm, it is purified of any realm.Thus the bodhisatva purifies his own sphere (svaviṣaya) by the purity of the sphe
re of the Buddha (buddhaviṣayapariśuddhi), and he thinks: “the realm of sight (cakṣurviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha,
and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.”Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is
the transcendent realm (vivekaviṣaya), and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of sight.The realm of hearing (śr
otraviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why is that? This
is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of hearing
.The realm of smelling (ghrāṇaviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or
farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent realm is b
eyond the realm of smelling.The realm of tasting (jihvāviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha, in the realm of the Buddha th
ere is no nearness or farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the tr
anscendent realm is beyond the realm of tasting.The realm of touching (kāyaviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha, in the re
alm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcende
nt realm, and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of touching.The realm of mind (manoviṣaya) is the realm of the 
Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Bud
dha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of mind.It is the same case with the parts
of personality, spheres, fields of sense perception, (skandhadhātvāyatana) and the twelve links of dependent originatio
n (dvādaśāṅga pratītyasamutpāda).In this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva enters into every realm as transcendent
, and belonging to the realm of the Buddha.Entering into the field of the Buddha (buddhakṣetrapraveśa) by the purity of 
his own field (svakṣetrapariśuddhi) is the following: All the moments of existence appearing in his six sense organs (ṣa
ḍindriya), all those he enters as being transcendent as realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣayaviveka).Just as the realm of th
e Tathāgata (tathāgataviṣaya) is unattached and unobstructed, so there is no attachment or obstruction in all realms.In 
this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva, entering into the realm of the Buddha, purifies his own realm.

28. DhāraṇīHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva who has attained memory never forget (tatra katamā kulaputra
bodhisatvasya dhāraṇīpratilabdhasya ’saṃpramoṣacaryā)?Son of good family, the bodhisatva attains memory (dhāraṇī) by pu
rifying his memory (dhāraṇīpariśodhana).
