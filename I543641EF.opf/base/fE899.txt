AbhayadānaAt that time, there were five hundred men who were in danger of being killed [by robbers.] When they were led t
o their death, a voice resonated in open space: “You should do homage to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, who provides fearle
ssness (abhaya) to the frightened, then you will be saved from death.”Then all those, terrified with the fear of death, 
said together in one voice: “Homage to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (namo gaganagañjāya bodhisatvāya mahā
satvāya)!”In that very moment, five hundred men, having descended from the open space and arrived at that place, said th
is to robbers (vadhakapuruṣa):“Why do you kill these poor men? Kill us, take our clothes and ornaments, and set them fre
e.”Then the robbers released the five hundred men to be killed because of vices caused by their greed, and killed the ma
gically created men.Then they, freed from the robbers, found their relief (āśvāsana) from the fear and terror (bhayabhīṭ
a) of being killed, went to the place where the bodhisatva Gaganagañja stayed, bowed down at the feet of the Buddha, joi
ned the palms of their hands (añjali), bowed to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, and said:“We survived and found relief becau
se of you, O Good man (satpuruṣa), please teach us the dharma which is the entrance into development for myself and othe
rs, because one can make progress in the dharma.”The bodhisatva Gaganagañja said: “Sons of good family, you should conce
ive the incomparable complete awakening (utpādayata idānīm anuttarāyāṃ samyakṣaṃbodhau cittam), in this way, you can pra
ctice what is benefit for yourselves and for others (ātmahitaparahita).”Thus addressed, they generated the thought of in
comparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi), and offered a hundred thousand calico clothes (duṣya) to the bod
hisatva Gaganagañja.Then, saying “Friends, let us also offer this calico clothes to the Lord,” all those offered calico 
clothes for the body of the Lord.Thereupon the Lord prophesied: “After incalculable aeons, when you achieved the way of 
the dharma which are wings of awakening (sarvabodhipakṣikadharmanaya), all of you will appear in this world as the tathā
gatas called Abhayadāna.”
