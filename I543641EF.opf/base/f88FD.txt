When the bodhisatvas rose into the vault of the sky, they listened to the preaching of the tathāgata. And the tathāgata t
aught the dharma-seal named gaganapariśuddhi. (sa tathāgato gaganapariśuddhir iti dharmamudrāṃ saṃprakāśayati sma)O Śāri
putra, it is impossible to enumerate the usufructs (paribhoga) of the bodhisatvas in the pavilion of the Mahāvyūha for t
heir entire lifespan.O Śāriputra, do you see this lion’s throne?” He said “Yes. O Lord, I see it.” (paśyasi śāriputraṃ s
iṃhāsanam | āha | paśyāmi bhagavan |)The Lord said: “O Śāriputra, the tathāgata Ekaratnavyūha, seating in the lion’s thr
one thus, explained the Dharma-seal called Gaganapariśuddhi to these bodhisatvas, which has thirty-two aspects of entran
ce (amīṣāṃ bodhisatvānāṃ gaganapariśuddhim dharmamudrām dvātriṃśadākārapraveśām saṃprakāśayati sma).What is this Dharma-
seal called Gaganapariśuddhi which has thirty-two forms of entrance (katamā dvātriṃśadākārapreveśā gaganapariśuddhir dha
rmamudrā)? 1Namely, 1) all moments of existence are free from existence and non-existence because they have no proper na
ture (tad yathā sarvadharmā bhāvābhāvavigatā niḥsvabhāvena);2) all moments of existence are without a proper nature, bec
ause of their essential characteristic of cognition (sarvadharmā niḥsvabhāvā vijñaptilakṣaṇena);3) all moments of existe
nce are without cognition because they are invisible (sarvadharmā avijñaptayo ’dṛśyena);4) all moments of existence are 
invisible because they lack causes and objects (sarvadharmā adṛśyā hetvālambanavigatena);5) all moments of existence lac
k objects because they are calm (sarvadharmā anālambanā upaśāntalakṣaṇena);6) all moments of existence are clam because 
they are without duality (sarvadharmā upaśāntā advayena) ;7) all moments of existence are without duality because of the
ir homogeneity (sarvadharmā advayā asaṃbhedena);8) all moments of existence are without difference as they can be approa
ched with one principle (sarvadharmā asaṃbhedā ekanayapraveśena);9) all moments of existence can be approached with one 
principle because they have no essential character of proper being (sarvadharmā ekanayapraveśāḥ svabhāvalakṣaṇavigatena)
;10) all moments of existence have no essential character of proper being because they completely transcend the three ti
mes (sarvadharmā svabhāvalakṣaṇavigatās tryadhvasamatikrāntena);11) all moments of existence are like the vault of the s
ky because they are not dependent on anything (sarvadharmā gaganatale sarvato ’pratiṣṭhitā aniśritena);12) all moments o
f existence is the entry into not being established anywhere because they are not manifested anywhere (sarvadharmā aprat
iṣṭhitapraveśāḥ sarvatrānābhāsena);13) all moments of existence are not manifested anywhere because they completely tran
scend the perceptual objects (sarvadharmā anābhāsā gocaramārgasamatikrāntena);14) all moments of existence are without o
bjects because of their purity of inner and outer (sarvadharmā aviṣayā ādhyātmabāhyaviśuddhyā);15) all moments of existe
nce are thoroughly pure because they are essentially beyond vices (sarvadharmā viśuddhāḥ svabhāvāsaṃkliṣṭena);16) all mo
ments of existence are fully purified because of their essential tranquility (sarvadharmā prakṛtipariśuddhāḥ svabhāvopaś
āntena);17) all moments of existence are tranquil because they are free from thought, mind and consciousness (sarvadharm
ā upaśāntā cittamanovijñānavigatena);18) all moments of existence lack characteristics because they are non-originated f
rom the very beginning (sarvadharmā svalakṣaṇavigatā ādyanutpannena);19) all moments of existence are non-originated fro
m the beginning because they are beyond what belongs to the ego and appropriation (sarvadharmā ādyanutpannā amamāparigra
heṇa ca);20) all moments of existence are beyond what belongs to the ego and appropriation because they have no owner (s
arvadharmā amamā aparigrahāś ca svāmikavigatena);21) all moments of existence have no owner because they are essentially
selfless (sarvadharmā asvāmikavigatāḥ svabhāvenānātmanā);22) all moments of existence are essentially selfless because 
they are originally pure (sarvadharmāḥ svabhāvenānātmāna ādiviśuddhyā);23) all moments of existence are originally pure 
because they never turn back (sarvadharmā ādiviśuddhā avinivartanena);24) all moments of existence never turn back becau
se their essence has the characteristic of an illusion (sarvadharmā avinivartanīyā māyālakṣaṇasvabhāvena);25) all moment
s of existence are like an illusion because they have no proper nature (sarvadharmā māyāsamā niḥsvabhāvena);26) all mome
nts of existence have no proper nature because their essential characteristics are unconditioned (sarvadharmā niḥsvabhāv
ā anabhisaṃskāralakṣaṇena);27) all moments of existence are unconditioned because of being detached from mind and body (
sarvadharmā anabhisaṃskārāś cittakāyavivekena);28) all moments of existence have the transcendent essential character be
cause they are beyond characteristics and do not have the character of characterizing something to be characterized (sar
vadharmā vivekalakṣaṇā alakṣaṇalakṣyalakṣaṇālakṣaṇa);29) all moments of existence lack characteristics because their def
ining character is neutralised (sarvadharmā alakṣaṇāḥ svalakṣaṇāniñjena);30) all moments of existence are neutral becaus
e they lack place of objective supports (sarvadharmā aniñjitāḥ sthānānālambhena);31) all moments of existence lack place
[of objective supports] because they are firmly rooted beyond objectification (sarvadharmā asthānā anālambanapratiṣṭite
na);32) all moments of existence are beyond objectification because they lack basis of all (sarvadharmā anālambanā anāla
yena);33) all moments of existence lack basis of all because they are free from basis of all (sarvadharmā ālayā ālayavig
atena);In this way, Śāriputra, the tathāgata Ekaratnavyūha elucidated the Dharma-seal called Gaganapariśuddhi to the bod
hisatvas, which has thirty-two forms of entrance. Having heard that, innumerable bodhisatvas attained (pratilabdha) the 
mastery of all moments of existence (sarvadharmādhipatya) and the tolerance (kṣānti) based on the pure cognition (viśudd
hajñāna) by supernormal knowledge (abhijñā).
