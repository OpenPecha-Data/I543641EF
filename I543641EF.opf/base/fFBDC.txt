Śāriputra

Then the venerable Śāriputra addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja (atha khalu āyuṣmañ śāriputro gaganagañjaṃ b
odhisatvam etad avocat): “After you established this treasury in the inexhaustible, imperishable, and permanent open spa
ce, son of good family, how long will it be continued?”Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Śāriputra, do you think the open spa
ce will be exhausted and destroyed, then disappear?”Śāriputra replied: “No indeed, son of good family.”Gaganagañja said:
“Venerable Śāriputra, in the same way awakening has the essential character of open space (tathā śāriputra bodhir gagan
asvabhāvalakṣaṇā), and, in the case, my roots of good are transformed into that. This is the reason why this treasury of
open space (gaganagañja) is inexhaustible, imperishable, and permanent.Again, as for your question regarding how long t
his treasury will be continued after having been established in open space, it will be continued as long as the thought 
of awakening (bodhicitta), generated by me, will be continued.Śāriputra asked: “Son of good family, how long will the th
ought of awakening (bodhicitta) be continued after having been generated by you?”Gaganagañja answered: “It is known by t
he knowledge of the Tathāgata (tathāgatajñāna).”The Śāriputra the Elder addressed himself to the Lord (atha khalu sthavi
raḥ śāriputrao bhagavantam etad avocat): “O Lord, how long the thought of awakening (bodhicitta) will be continued after
the bodhisatva Gaganagañja produced it?”The Lord said: “If the Tathāgata teaches this subject (sthāna), all of the worl
d including the gods (sadevaloka) will be confused (pramatta).Śāriputra said: “O Lord, there are many living beings in t
his assembly who are very thoughtful (pratyavekṣaṇābahula) and faithful, so please teach us.”The Lord said: “It is like 
this, Śāriputra, as if the world-spheres as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā (gaṅgānadīvālukopama) are 
filled with the atomic-sized dust of buddha-fields as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, as if all the a
tomic-sized dust (paramāṇurajas) is put into a single dust grain of a field during many hundreds of thousands of aeons, 
in the same way of calculating and establishing distinguishing marks (gaṇanānimittapratiṣṭhāpana), even though all the d
ust would be exhausted, the thought of incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi), which was produced by t
he bodhisatva Gaganagañja, for the uncountable hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of ages (asaṃkhyeyakalpakoṭīniyut
aśatasahasra), would never be exhausted (parikṣi-).”Śāriputra said: “O Lord, What is the name of the tathāgata when the 
thought of awakening was produced by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja for the first time?”The Lord said: “At the time, Śāriput
ra, the tathāgata Sarvapraṇidhānaratnatejobhyugatāryarāja, worthy of offerings, the perfectly awakened one, perfect in w
isdom and conduct, a sugata, a knower of the world, a charioteer of human beings to be tamed, unsurpassable, a teacher o
f gods and men, a buddha, a blessed one appeared in the aeon called Ratnavyūha, in the universe called Sarvabuddhakṣetra
darśana (tena ca śāriputra kālena tena samayena sarvapraṇidhānaratnatejobhyugatāryarājo nāma tathāgato ’rhan samyakṣaṃbu
ddho vidyācaraṇasaṃpannaḥ sugato lokavid anuttaraḥ puruṣadamyasārathiḥ śāstā devamanuṣyāṇāṃ buddho bhagavān sarvabuddhak
ṣetradarśane lokadhātu ratnavyūhe kalpe).Again, Śāriputra, it is not easy to express the splendor of the virtues of that
tathāgata’s buddha-field (buddhakṣetraguṇavyūha), remaining here with a life-span of a world-age (kalpāyuṣpramāṇasthity
ā).Śāriputra, the whole retinue (parṣanmaṇḍala) of that tathāgata reached to thousands of world-sphere, and the congrega
tion of the bodhisatvas (bodhisatvasaṃgha) was incalculable.And, Śāriputra, a universal king (cakravartirāja) called Sar
vadevābhiṣeka appeared in three-thousandfold universe (trisāhasra), who had a inconceivable treasury of jewels (acintyar
atnagañja).He had ninety six thousand sons who were spontaneously generated (upapāduka) by his own majesty (svatejas).Wh
y is that? Because there has been not even the concept of woman in that buddha-field.Śāriputra, that tathāgata lived for
one hundred thousand aeons.At that time, the king Sarvadevābhiṣeka had paid homage and respect to the Lord for forty in
ternal aeons (antarakalpa), making offerings of a heap of jewels (ratnarāśi), as much as Mount Sumeru, every single day.
By the firmness of his merits (puṇya), the king, his sons, his village’s people and retinues generated the thought of in
comparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi).Śāriputra, [if you think that,] at that time, the universal king 
Sarvadevābhiṣeka was a someone else, you should not think so (na khalu punar evaṃ draṣṭavyam).Why is that? It is the bod
hisatva Gaganagañja, who, during that period of time, was the Sarvadevābhiṣeka, the universal king of the three-thousand
fold universe (tat kasmād dhetoḥ | gaganagañjaḥ sa bodhisatvo tena kālena samayena sarvadevābhiṣeko nāma rājābhūc cakrav
artī trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātau).”Then the venerable Śāriputra addressed himself to the Lord (atha khalu āyuṣmañ śā
riputro bhagavantam etad avocat):“It is a marvelous thing, Lord, the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, being clad in the inconceiv
able armour (acintyaṃ saṃnāhaṃ saṃnaddhaḥ), has ridden in the great vehicle (mahāyāna) during that time.Lord, by such be
haviour and such dharma, he was able to obtain the great power (mahānubhāva).”The Lord said: “Since this bodhisatva Gaga
nagañja paid homage and respect to the Awakened Lords as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā (gaṅgānadīvāl
ikāsama), Śāriputra, his thought of awakening (bodhicitta) was purified;by purifying his thought of awakening as numerou
s as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, his intention (āśaya) was purified;by purifying his intention as numerous as
the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, his practice (prayoga) was purified;by purifying his practice as numerous as the
grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, his determination (adhyāśaya) was purified;by purifying his determination as numerou
s as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection of generosity (dānapāramitā) was purified;by purifying the pe
rfection of generosity as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection of morality (śīlapāramitā) w
as purified;by purifying the perfection of morality as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection
of endurance (kṣāntipāramitā) was purified;by purifying the perfection of endurance as numerous as the grains of sand i
n the river Gaṅgā, the perfection of vigour (vīryapāramitā) was purified;by purifying the perfection of vigour as numero
us as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection of meditation (dhyānapāramitā) was purified;by purifying the
perfection of meditation as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection of insight (prajñāpāramit
ā) was purified;by purifying the perfection of insight as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfect
ion of skillful means (upāyapāramitā) was purified;by purifying the perfection of insight as numerous as the grains of s
and in the river Gaṅgā, the unhindered thoughts and unobstructed rays of light to all beings (sarvasatvāpratihatacittāpr
atihataraśmi) were purified;by purifying unhindered thoughts and unobstructed rays of light to all beings as numerous as
the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, great friendliness (mahāmaitrī) was purified, thereby great compassion (mahākaru
ṇā), great delight (mahāmuditā), great equanimity (mahopekṣā), and the knowledge of the great supernormal knowledges (ma
hābhijñājñāna) were purified;in the same way, his bodily action, speech, and thought (kāyavākcitta) were purified, then 
by purifying his thoughts as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, one characteristic of a great man (mahāp
uruṣalakṣaṇa) was purified;and so on, up to: having purified all the thirty-two marks of a great man (sarvadvātriṃśanmah
āpuruṣalakṣaṇa), his roots of good (kuśalamūla) was purified; by purifying his roots of good as numerous as the grains o
f sand in the river Gaṅgā, this bodhisatva Gaganagañja was purified in order to purify this treasury of open space (gaga
nagañjapariśodhana).Śāriputra, this bodhisatva Gaganagañja demonstrated all those practices of the bodhisatva (sarvabodh
isatvacaryā) in the open space. And, Śāriputra, just as the open space is imperishable, just so, by purifying all vows a
nd practices (praṇidhānacaryā) of this son of good family, all of them are also imperishable. Therefore it is called ‘th
e treasury of open space (gaganagañja).’”When this teaching was declared (iha nirdeśe nirdiśyamāne), a thousand bodhisat
vas (bodhisatvasahasra), holding jewels of inexhaustible wealth in their hands (akṣayabhogaratnapāṇi), produced the tole
rance of fulfilling the vows of the treasury of open space.
