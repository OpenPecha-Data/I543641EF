27. BuddhaviṣayaHow then, son of good family, does the own realm (svaviṣaya) of the bodhisatva become pure, when he has a
ttained the realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya)?‘The realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya)’ is not a realm, and since it is 
non-realm, it is purified of any realm.Thus the bodhisatva purifies his own sphere (svaviṣaya) by the purity of the sphe
re of the Buddha (buddhaviṣayapariśuddhi), and he thinks: “the realm of sight (cakṣurviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha,
and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.”Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is
the transcendent realm (vivekaviṣaya), and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of sight.The realm of hearing (śr
otraviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why is that? This
is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of hearing
.The realm of smelling (ghrāṇaviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or
farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent realm is b
eyond the realm of smelling.The realm of tasting (jihvāviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha, in the realm of the Buddha th
ere is no nearness or farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the tr
anscendent realm is beyond the realm of tasting.The realm of touching (kāyaviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha, in the re
alm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcende
nt realm, and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of touching.The realm of mind (manoviṣaya) is the realm of the 
Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Bud
dha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of mind.It is the same case with the parts
of personality, spheres, fields of sense perception, (skandhadhātvāyatana) and the twelve links of dependent originatio
n (dvādaśāṅga pratītyasamutpāda).In this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva enters into every realm as transcendent
, and belonging to the realm of the Buddha.Entering into the field of the Buddha (buddhakṣetrapraveśa) by the purity of 
his own field (svakṣetrapariśuddhi) is the following: All the moments of existence appearing in his six sense organs (ṣa
ḍindriya), all those he enters as being transcendent as realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣayaviveka).Just as the realm of th
e Tathāgata (tathāgataviṣaya) is unattached and unobstructed, so there is no attachment or obstruction in all realms.In 
this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva, entering into the realm of the Buddha, purifies his own realm.
