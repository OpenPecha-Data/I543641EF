12. ŚīlānusmṛtiSon of good family, how does the recollection of morality of bodhisatva becomes like open space (tatra kat
haṃ kulaputra bodhisatvasya buddhānujñātā śīlānusmṛtir gaganasamā)?.What we called ‘morality (śīla)’ is unconditioned (a
saṃskṛta), unsullied (anāsrava), no wishful thinking (apraṇidhāna), effortless (anābhoga), and it accomplishes vows (sid
dhavrata), fulfils the vows (vrataparipūri), and does not have essential characteristic of information (vijñaptilakṣaṇa)
.Since it is established by concentration (samādhi), it is not established in the object of thought (cittopalaṃbha).Sinc
e it is the root of insight (prajñāmūla), it is without essential characteristic of discursive thinking (niḥprapañcalakṣ
aṇa).Since it is the outcome of liberation (vimuktiniṣyanda), it is not distinguished by duality (advayaprabhāvita).Sinc
e there is no visual form, it is praised by the wise (pāṇḍitapraśaṃsita).Since it appeases vices (kleśapraśamana), there
is no essential characteristic of recognition (aprativijñaptilakṣaṇa).Since it is in accordance with all happiness (sar
vasukhānugata) and is not generated by the contrary (pratipakṣaprabhāvita), while recollecting this morality, there is n
o impurity (anāvila) in the recollection. Son of good family, this is what is called the recollection of morality which 
is authorized by the Lord (sa kulaputra bodhisatvasya buddhānujñātā śīlānusmṛtiḥ).
