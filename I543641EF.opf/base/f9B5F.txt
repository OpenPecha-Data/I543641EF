23. Pratītyasamutpādagaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 3Son of good family, how does the bodhisatva become skilled in knowing
the entrance into the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādapraveśajñanakuśala), and become free from two extreme vie
ws (sarvāntadvayadṛṣṭivivarjita)?.Son of good family, the bodhisatva should think like this (iha bodhisatvasyaivaṃ bhava
ti):that on which there is dependence, that is nothing in particular (yat pratītya tat kiṃcin nāsti);that on which there
is dependence, that is inexistent (yat pratītya so ’bhāvaḥ);that on which there is dependence, that is not being establ
ished in reality (yat pratītya tad apariniṣpannam);that on which there is dependent origination, that is impermanence, s
uffering, selflessness and quiescence (yat pratītyasaṃutpannaṃ tad anityaduḥkhānātmaśāntam);in the dependent origination
, there is no self, no being, no life-principle, no life-sustaining principle, no spirit, no personality, no human being
, no man (na satvajīvapoṣapuruṣapudgalamanujamānava);in the dependent origination there is no attainment (samudgama);in 
the dependent origination there is nothing, and it is effortless (avyāyāma), empty (śūnya), no distinguishing mark (anim
itta), transcendent (viveka), no activity (apracāra), no discursive thinking (aprapañca), and thus beyond discursive thi
nking (niṣprapañca).Thus origination (jāti) is just the arising of the dharma, and cessation (nirodha) is also the ceasi
ng of the dharma.Therefore it is said that there is no self, being, life-principle, life-sustaining principle, spirit, p
ersonality, human being, or man (satvajīvapoṣapuruṣapudgalamanujamānava);In the dharmas which are dependently originated
there is no true origination (jāti) and there is no owner (svāmika).Because of that, all dharmas are like grass, trees,
walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsasadṛśa).Just as there is nothing that produces external th
ings when they are originated, and there is nothing that ceases external things when they cease, just so, there is nothi
ng that produces internal things when they are originated, and there is nothing that ceases internal things when they ce
ase;But rather, when conditions (pratyaya) exist they will arise, and when conditions are completely exhausted they will
be destroyed.”If you understand this knowledge in that way, you will overcome any extreme view (sarvāntadṛṣṭi).What the
n are extreme views (antadṛṣṭi)?‘Extreme (anta)’ means discontinuity (uccheda) and continuity (nitya), and that which is
not originated and ceased is beyond discontinuity and continuity and thus pure, and therefore it is purified when conce
rned with any extreme view (sarvāntadṛṣṭi).In that way, son of good family, the bodhisatva becomes skilled in knowing th
e entrance into the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādapraveśajñanakuśala) and free from any extreme view (sarvānta
dṛṣṭi).
