Then, in order to clarify this point further, the Lord went on to speak these verses: (atha khalu tasyāṃ velāyāṃ imā gāth
ā abhāṣata)

52 The knowledge of cessation (kṣayajñāna) is imperishable (akṣaya) and pure patience since the mind is cultivated withou
t any attachment to any object.Patience becomes the highest thought like empty space when its outside and inside (adhyāt
mabhāhya) are pure and it fixed anywhere.

53 This body (kāya) is just as a reflection, grass, tree, and wall, (pratibhāsatṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyasadṛśa) and thought (citta)
is formless and invisible like as illusion (māyā).This dharma is like empty space, since having no particular basis. Th
us body is changeless (avikāra) and mind has no anger (apratighāta).

54 Homage (satkāra) should be beyond attachment and ill-will, it should not discriminate (vikḷp) between superior, inferi
or.The religious way (yāna) which is just like the ground and threshold (indrakīla), teaches patience in order to purify
living beings.

55 Enduring the fact that all dharmas are empty since there is no life, individual self, or living being (nirjīvaniḥsvapu
dgalaniḥsatva), and not inconsistent with causes, conditions, and effects (hetupratyayakāryāvirodha). Such is the most t
rue and highest exposition of patience.

56 Never responding to the words of abuse, and never getting angry like the thundercloud (meghasvara) in the sky.With a m
ind purified of self, seeing absolute emptiness, in this teaching I preach patience in order to purify living beings.

4. VīryaHow, son of good family, does the vigour of the bodhisatva becomes like empty space (kathaṃ kulaputra bodhisatvas
ya vīryaṃ gaganasamam)?
