Son of good family, the vigour of the bodhisatva becomes like empty space when he is endowed with four qualities. What ar
e those four? (caturbhir dharmaiḥ kulaputra samanvāgatasya bodhisatvasya vīryaṃ gaganasamaṃ bhavati | katame catvāraḥ)a)
even though he strives to attain all roots of good he has the insight that all dharmas are imperfect (sarvakuśalamūleṣv
ārabhamāṇo ’py apariniṣpannān sarvadharmān prajānāti);b) even though honouring and serving all Buddhas, he sees clearly
the sameness of the true body of the Tathāgata (sarvabuddheṣu pūjopashānam abhisaṃskaroty api tathāgatasya dharmakāyasa
matāṃ samanupaśyati).c) even though he brings living beings to maturity, he does not apprehend living beings – as they a
re already pure (satvān paripācayan api satvān nopalabhate satvaviśuddhatayā);d) even though embracing the true religion
of all the Buddhas he never sees the dharmas free from cupidity [as real entities] (sarvabuddhasaddharmān parigṛhṇāty a
pi na vigatarāgadharmān samanupaśyati).When the bodhisatva, the great being, is endowed with those four dharmas, son of 
good family, his vigour becomes like empty space (tair caturbhir dharmaiḥ kulaputra samanvāgatasya bodhisatvasya mahāsat
vasya vīryaṃ gaganasamaṃ bhavati).
