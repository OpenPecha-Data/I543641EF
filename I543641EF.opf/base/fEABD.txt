18. DharmasvabhāvaBut further, son of good family, in the perspective of the essential character of the dharma (dharmasva
bhāva), the bodhisatva may grasp an essential character, thinking: “I have fully understood (abhisambuddha) the dharmas.
”But, how then has the Tathāgata understood (abhisaṃbuddha) the dharmas?[It is like this:] their nature is [like] illusi
on (māyāsvabhāva) because it is not established in reality (apariniṣpanna);their nature is [like] a dream (svapna) becau
se it transcends perceptual fields (viṣayātikrantatarayogena);their nature is [like] a mirage (marīci) because there is 
no birth (atyantānutpanna);their nature is [like] a reflected image (pratibhāsa) because it is unchanging (asaṃkrānti);t
heir nature is [like] a reflection (pratibimba) because it is devoid of intrinsic nature (niḥsvabhāva);their nature is e
mpty (sūnya) because it is dependent (aparādhīna);their nature is without distinguishing mark (animitta) because it is b
eyond thought-constructions (nirvikalpa);their nature is wishless (apraṇihita) because it is not attached to thoughts (c
ittāsaṅga);their nature has no desire (rāga) because it is free from all desires (sarvarāgavigata);their nature is uncon
ditioned (asaṃskṛta) because there is no any calculation (asaṃkhya).Thus, son of good family, based on the information (
prajñapti) in conventional expressions (vyavahāra) of others I was fully awakened (abhisaṃbuddha) to such dharmas,but st
ill, their essential character (dharmasvabhāvalakṣaṇa) is inexpressible in words.Even though the bodhisattva, who wishes
to grasp the dharmas, is fully awakened to dharmas with such an essential character, he still teaches other beings (par
asatvapudgala) by means of syllables and explanations of language (akṣaranirukti).
