Son of good family, the meditation of the bodhisatva becomes like the expanse of the sky when he is endowed with the four
dharmas. What are those four? (caturbhir dharmaiḥ kulaputra samanvāgatasya bodhisatvasya dhyānaṃ gaganasamā bhavati | k
atame catvāraḥ)To wit, a) even if his thought is still during in the meditative absorption (pratisaṃlayana), he does not
make it as an object of particular reflection (na samanupaśyati);b) while turning back the thought from outside, the ex
ternal thought (bahirdhācitta) is still in activity, but he has no conception of it (nopalabhate);c) by the sameness of 
his own thoughts (svacittasamatā) he enters into concentration (samāpatti) on the universal sameness of the thoughts of 
all beings (sarvasatvacittasamatā);d) and that the sameness of the thoughts is the entering into concentration on the sa
meness of all dharmas being like an illusion;When he is endowed with those four dharmas, son of good family, the meditat
ion of the bodhisatva becomes like the expanse of the sky (caturbhir dharmaiḥ kulaputra samanvāgatasya bodhisatvasya dhy
ānaṃ gaganasamaṃ bhavati).
