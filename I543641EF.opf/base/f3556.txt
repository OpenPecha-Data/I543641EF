Ratnaśrī

gaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 6Then the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good
family, was the supramunane way purified by you?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, it was purified by purifying my
self.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, how did you purify yourself?”Gaganagañja said: “Since this world is pure, son 
of good family, I am originally pure.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, what is the purity of the world?”Gaganagañja s
aid: “Since the form (rūpa) is originally pure, it is deathless (acyuta).Since the form in the future will be pure, it i
s without coming.Since the form in the present is pure, it is established in the true state (dharmatāsthita).In the same
way, since the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are originally pu
re, those are deathless.Since the consciousness (vijñāna) in the future will be pure, it is without coming.Since the con
sciousness in the present is pure, it is established in the true state (dharmatā). Son of good family, this is the purit
y of the world.”Ratnaśrī said: “As for the pure world, where can we see it?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, you c
an see such pure world in all dharmas.”Ratnaśrī said: “How can we see all the dharmas?"Gaganagañja said: “It is when we 
know how to distinguish the past and future of all dharmas by means of insight and knowledge (prajñājñāna)”Ratnaśrī said
: “How do you distinguish the past and future of all dharmas?”Gaganagañja said: “Where there is no cessation (pariccheda
) or eternity (śāśvata).”Ratnaśrī said: “Where is no cessation or eternity?”Gaganagañja said: “Where there is no cessati
on or eternity there is no origination or extinction (anutpannāniruddhatā).”Ratnaśrī said: “What is this place without o
rigination or extinction?”Gaganagañja said: “It cannot be verbally expressed.”Ratnaśrī said: “Why is that?”Gaganagañja s
aid: “Because the dharma is incalculable and ineffable.”Ratnaśrī: “Son of good family, how can you count the incalculabl
e dharmas (asaṃkhyeyadharma)?”Gaganagañja said: “Just as, even though on the earth it is possible to measure open space,
in open space it is impossible, just so, even though it is possible to measure by means of calculation (gaṇanamukhena),
it is still impossible to measure by means of calculation. This is because the nature of the means of calculation is no
n-calculation.”Ratnaśrī said: “What then are the means of calculation and the means without calculation?”Gaganagañja sai
d: “The means of calculation is conditioned (saṃskṛta), and the means without calculation is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta).T
herefore, that which is without calculation in the unconditioned is beyond calculation, and that which is beyond calcula
tion is unconditioned, thus the Lord said that by means of insight one should calculate, investigate, and give up what i
s to be given up.Accordingly, when the bodhisatva calculates the dharma in the conditioned, measures it in his conscious
ness, and reflects on it in the right way, he never sees any dharma which is to be fully known (parijñeya), to be elimin
ated (prahātavya), to be realized (sākṣātkartavya), or to be cultivated (bhāvayitavya).Since the bodhisatva never sees a
ny dharma, he does not establish any dharma.Where he does not establish any dharma, there is the attainment of the absen
ce of basis (anālaya).Where he attains the absence of basis, there is not anything to be wanted.Where there is nothing t
o be wanted, there is nothing to be obtained.Since he is free from mental conception (upalambha), there is nothing relat
ed to the self (amama) or nothing to be grasped (aparigraha).What is non-grasping? It is not grasping permanence or impe
rmanence in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna);it
is not grasping suffering or happiness in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness; 
it is not grasping the self or selflessness in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousne
ss;it is not grasping the beautiful or the ugly in from, as well as in [feeling, perception, formative factors or] consc
iousness; it is not grasping emptiness or non-emptiness in from, as well as in [feeling, perception, formative factors o
r] consciousness.Even though he does not grasp anything, he attains concentration (samādhi). He stays within existence (
saṃsāra), but he never grasps any vice of existence.Even though he makes living beings believe in extinction, he attaine
d extinction from the beginning (ādiparinirvṛta).What then is the extinction of the bodhisatva?Extinction (parinirvāṇa) 
is the unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta).Even though the bodhisatva never makes even a small bad action (akuśalakarman), he
still enters into grasping for the good actions (kuśaladharma).Since the bodhisatva makes all composite things (sarvasa
ṃskṛta) as belonging to body, speech, and mind (kāyavākcitta), he, having investigated them, transforms them into omnisc
ience.He does not seek omniscience as form nor feeling, nor perception, nor formative factors, nor consciousness.Because
he is not attached to his thoughts and morality, while fulfilling all his vows (sarvapraṇidhāna), he never sees (na sam
anupaśyati) the dharma in which there is increase or decrease.Since the dharma does not decrease nor increase, the bodhi
satva, having attained the sameness of all dharmas (sarvadharmasamatā), performs the practice of a bodhisatva, being est
ablished in the absolute reality (dharmadhātu), thus he neither performs nor practices any dharma.Son of good family, th
e bodhisatva who has attained such extinction performs the practice of the bodhisatva (bodhisatvacaryā).Why is that? Whe
n the bodhisatva is established in the unconditioned (abhisaṃskāra) among all constructed, he attains extinction, and th
erefore the bodhisatva does not construct things among all the constructed things. Thus the unconditioned is called ‘ext
inction (parinirvāṇa)’ because it is not conditioned.Since the other shore (pāra) is that which does not enter into cons
ciousness (vijñāna), the bodhisatva is characterized (prabhāvita) as having no conceptual activity (avijñapti), thus it 
is called ‘extinction.’Since the other shore is without distinguishing marks (animitta), the bodhisatva does not transfo
rm his thoughts into distinguishing marks, thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since the other shore is beyond false imaginat
ion (parikalpa), his thoughts do not enter into the imagination, thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since the other shore is
baseless, he does not transform his thoughts into the absence of basis (anālaya), thus it is called ‘extinction.’Theref
ore, son of good family, this is the extinction of the bodhisatva, namely performing the practice of the bodhisatva.Then
the Lord applauded the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (atha khalu bhagavān gaganagañjāya bodhisatvāya mahāsatv
āya sādhukāram adāt): “Well done, good man, well done (sādhu sādhu satpuruṣa). If it should be explained, I will say lik
e that.”When this teaching was declared, five hundred bodhisatvas produced the tolerance [that all things are unborn (an
utpattikadharmakṣānti)].Then the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, we atta
ined eloquence by this light of the dharma from the tathāgata (tathāgatadharmāloka).Just as forms appear in dependence o
n light, so we attained shining eloquence by the power generated by the tathāgata.”Then the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī said thi
s to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, why do you hide your knowledge and teach that you attained eloquen
ce by the presence of the Buddha (buddhādhiṣṭhāna)?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, all the eloquence of the bodh
isatvas, even a small part of it, should be seen as the presence of the Buddha. Why is that? If the buddhas do not make 
those dharmas appear, how could the bodhisatva attain eloquence?”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, how is the eloquenc
e transferred?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, there is no transference [of eloquence,] but, nevertheless, the el
oquence is attained by the eloquence of the Buddha.”Just as, even though ignorance (avidyā) is not transferred to the fo
rmative factors (saṃskāra), the formative factors are produced by the cause of ignorance, just so, even though the eloqu
ence of the Buddha is not transferred anywhere, by its cause the eloquence still arises.Just as the sounds of horses, el
ephants, and human beings (hayagajamanuṣyakāḥ śabdāḥ) are not transferred to an echo (pratiśrutkā) but because of it the
echo (pratiśrutkā) arises, just so the eloquence of the Buddha is not transferred anywhere but by its cause the eloquen
ce still arises.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda) is profound (gambhīra).”G
aganagañja said: “In the same way any dharma is never born.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, what is it that there is
no dependent origination of any dharma?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, if a certain agent (kartṛ) is in conditi
ons, the dharmas will be born, but, because any agent is not apprehended in conditions, the agent is not apprehended in 
any dharma.Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, what is it that the Tathāgata never appears?”Gaganagañja said: “if suchne
ss arises, the tathāgata will appear, but still we hold the view that suchness never arises. Why is that? Suchness is br
ought about (prabhāvita) through non-arising. One who understands all dharmas just like the suchness, he is called the t
athāgata.Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, why did the tathāgata come?”Gaganagañja said: “Something like that should b
e let alone (sthāpanīya).”Ratnaśrī said: “What is this letting alone?”Gaganagañja said: “Because the absolute truth (dha
rmadhātu) is in accordance with its proper place (yathāsthāna).”Ratnaśrī said: “What is the place of the absolute truth?
”Gaganagañja said: “It is not the place of birth nor the place of death, it is neither a place nor non-place. Such a pla
ce is the place of the absolute truth, and just the place of absolute truth is the place of all dharmas.The place of all
dharmas is not a place, and that which is not a place is without place because there is no place of birth or place of d
eath, thus it is neither a place nor non-place. Such is the place of the tathāgata which is not considered as the place 
of birth nor the place of cessation.In this way, son of good family, that the tathāgata appears is an extreme (eko ’ntaḥ
) and that the tathāgata never appears is another extreme, thus you should seek the tathāgata from the middle way (madhy
amapratipad) which is free from both extremes, namely the existence of birth or the non-existence of birth.”Ratnaśrī sai
d: “Son of good family, although that the buddha arises from the absence of the place of birth or death is profound, son
of good family, who would believe this appearing of the buddha?”Gaganagañja said: “One who does not make any matter of 
dispute (adhikaraṇa).”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, how is ‘matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa)’ explained?”Gaganagañja
said: “Son of good family, ‘matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa)’ is a word for imputing (samāropa).One who does not impute a
nything to any dharma does not makes any matter of dispute concerning any dharma, therefore a word for ‘no matter of dis
pute’ is a word for sameness (samatā);a word for sameness is a word for the incomparable (asadṛśa);a word for the incomp
arable is a word for the absence of words (apada);a word for the absence of words is a word for the absence of letters (
anakṣara);a word for the absence of letters is a word for the absence of information (avijñapti);a word for the absence 
of information, in which there is no activity (apracāra) of thoughts and mind (cittamanas), is a word for the absence of
activity;Just as, even though bird-tracks do not remain in the sky, we still talk about it with the place of sound, in 
the same way, whether the buddha is born or unborn, we still talk about it with the word to be born.In that case, even t
hough the bodhisatva teaches non-origination (anutpāda), he still makes things appear.Why is that? Because the essential
nature of all dharmas (sarvadharmasvabhāva) is the essential nature of unbornness (anutpādasavabhāva);the essential nat
ure of unbornness (anutpādasvabhāva) is without own nature (niḥsvabhāva);that which has no essential nature, in that the
re is no existence;that in which there is no existence, that is established nowhere, thus all dharmas are the limit esta
blished nowhere (apratiṣṭhitakoṭi);the limit established nowhere is the limit of all dharmas, thus all the dharmas are c
alled ‘being established in the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi)’;what is called the limit of reality is the unlimited limit
(aparicchinnakoṭi);since the limit is in accordance with all limits, all dharmas appear as having attained the limit.Wh
y is that? Because, even if the limit attains another part of the sky, it is still the same limit in the sky. Just as th
ere is no border dividing the sky, just so there is no limit of any dharma (sarvadharmakoṭi) in the limit of reality (bh
utakoṭi).Since the limit of reality is the limit of the self (ātmakoṭi), by knowing the limit of the self, the knowledge
of the limit of all beings is understood.Since the limit of all dharmas is unified with the limit of all beings, all dh
armas are called ‘the limit of exhaustion (kṣaya), the end of exhaustion, and the ultimate of exhaustion.’What is called
‘exhaustion (kṣaya)’ is a designation (adhivacana) for extinction (nirvāṇa), and thus all dharmas are the same as extin
ction.Why is that? Because it is without adversary (niṣpratipakṣa).Just as there is no adversary in open space, so there
is no adversary in all dharmas.Those who seek extinction (nirvāṇa) in the perspective of an adversary see birth and dea
th, and those who think that these dharmas will be born and will die never know the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamat
ā) since they practice in birth and death.Therefore, the Lord said “You should know! you should know! Do not dispute! Do
not dispute! Fulfill the indisputable excellent qualities of ascetics (śrāmaṇa)!”
