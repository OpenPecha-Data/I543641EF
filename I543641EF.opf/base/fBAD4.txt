16. CaritalakṣaṇaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva know1 the essential character of behaviour of all livi
ng beings (sarvasatvacaritalakṣaṇa)?There, son of good family, are eighty-four thousand kinds of behaviour of living bei
ngs (caturaśītisatvacaritasahasra), and these are the basic words of a summary (mūloddānapada).The behaviour of all livi
ng beings, which is immeasureable (sarvasatvacaritāpramāṇa), unthinkable (acintya), and ineffable (anabhilāpya), is know
n by the knowledge of a Buddha (buddhajñāna), but not by the knowledge of the disciples, the isolated buddhas (śrāvakapr
atyekabuddhajñāna), or the knowledge of bodhisatva (bodhisatvajñāna).Thus the bodhisatva penetrates the essential charac
ter of behaviour of all living beings (sarvasatvacaritalakṣaṇānupraveśa) through the presence of the Buddhas (buddhādhiṣ
ṭhāna) and his own knowledge (ātmajñāna).The behaviour’s essence (svabhāva), essential character (lakṣaṇa), the essentia
l character of cause (hetulakṣaṇa), the essential character of condition (pratyayalakṣaṇa), the essential character of p
roductive cause (karaṇahetulakṣaṇa), the essential character of combination (sāmagrīlakṣaṇa), the essential character of
difference (nānātvalakṣaṇa), the essential character of discordance (vilakṣaṇa), the essential character of passion (rā
galakṣaṇa), the essential character of aversion (dveṣalakṣaṇa), the essential character of delusion (mohalakṣaṇa), the e
ssential character of the three together (sabhāgalakṣaṇa), the essential character of hell-beings (nirayalakṣaṇa), the a
nimal world (tiryagyonilakṣaṇa), the essential character of the world of the lord of death (yamalokalakṣaṇa), the essent
ial character of gods (devalakṣaṇa), the essential character of human being (manuṣyalakṣaṇa), the essential character of
the entrance into the fixed course of disciples (śrāvakaniyāmāvakranti), the essential character of the entrance into t
he fixed course of isolated buddhas (pratyekabuddhaniyāmalakṣaṇa), the essential character of the entrance into the fixe
d course of the buddhas (buddhaniyāmalakṣaṇa), the essential character of distant cause, the essential character of inte
rmediate cause (anantaryalakṣaṇa), and the essential character of immediate cause - he knows all the essential character
s of behaviour truly as they are (yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti), and there is no fault at all (anavadya) in his understanding (
sarvajñāna).
