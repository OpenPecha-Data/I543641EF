the messengers or partisans of the Māra (mārapakṣa), deny the true dharma (saddharma).198 Having bad morality (duḥśīla)
and non-dharma (adharma), staying close to secular people, desiring fame and gain, they will not seek the dharma.199 Be
ing mingled with materialists (lokāyata), praising themselves, disparaging noble ones, they will be ignorant and arrogan
t.200 Giving up to stay in the wilderness (araṇya), always taking pleasure among the crowds of people (saṃsarga), practi
cing worldly incantations (laukikamantra), they will be attached to [the view] that there is a permanent substance (satk
āya).201 The ignorant among monks, devoting themselves to observances, giving up to practice meditation (dhyāna), will n
ot act in accordance with the three jewels (triratna).202 Without learning or morality, seeking a profit within the cong
regation, and exerting themselves all over the time to get gifts, they will be full of thought-constructions (vikalpa) w
ith distress (śoka).203 Holding the concept of self (ātmasaṃjñā), taking pleasure in begging at the homes [of lay people
] together with friends, and entering into them, they will engage in discourses on worldly things.204 Engaging in farmin
g, housework, and business, having ploughs and harrows, they will still say “We are ascetics (śramaṇa).”205 Being attach
ed to objects (ālambana), being established in various views (nānādṛṣṭi), after having heard the teaching of emptiness (
śūnyatādharma), they will [regard it] as the abyss (prapāta).206 Not concerned with the next world (paraloka), giving up
the fruition of actions (karmavipāka), and telling lies (mṛṣāvāda), they will regard the non-dharma as the dharma.207 I
n such a time of great terror and disruption for living beings, agitating ascetics and kings alike, we will uphold the t
rue dharma.(evaṃ vighe mahāghore bhikṣurājānakṣobhaṇe1 |vilopakāle satvānāṃ saddharma dhārayāmahe ||)ŚikṣMS: evaṃ vidhe

n. This is not mere words.232 O King of the dharma (dharmarāja), the Light-maker (prabhākara), when this true dharma wil
l be grasped, how much accumulation of merits (puṇyasaṃbhāra) will be there?

At that time, the Lord said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Even if, son of good family, every thirty thousand world-
system in the east is broken into the atomic-sized raindrops or the atomic-sized particles, and in the same way every th
irty thousand world-system in the south, west, north, above, below and ten directions is also broken into the atomic-siz
ed particles, and even if the buddha-fields in east, as numerous as all the particles, are put into one single atomic-si
zed particle, and in the same way, even if one calculates every single particle in the east until it is exhausted, it wo
uld not be enough to equal with the number of the buddha-fields,and just like in the east, the buddha-fields in each of 
the ten directions are immeasurable.What do you think, son of good family (tat kiṃ manyase kulaputra), can you calculate
the particles in the ten directions, each of them contains the buddha-fields of the ten directions in such a way? Can y
ou understand its limit?”Gaganagañja replied: “O Lord, nobody can do that. But the tathāgata is an exception, who knows 
it by means of the unattached knowledge of the buddha (buddhāsaṅgajñāna).”The Lord said: “If, son of good family, in all
such buddha-fields there is a place in which the particles are posited, if all the buddha-fields become a town after ha
ving been encircled by a wall, and if the town, from its subterranean mass of water up to its highest point, is filled w
ith only mustard seeds without roughness, then, what do you think, son of good family, how many mustard seeds would be t
here?”Gaganagañja said: “O Lord, it is marvelous that such analogy was sought out by the tathāgata. Having heard this an
alogy, O Lord, those living beings with faith will come to be endowed with a most marvelous thing (āścaryādbhutadharma).
”The Lord said: “Son of good family, how many hundreds of, how many thousands of, how many hundred thousands of, how man
y vivāhas of, or how many akṣobhyas of mustard seeds there are, or how many buddha-fields there are, how many hundreds o
f buddha-fields there are, how many thousands of buddha-fields there are, or how many hundred thousands of buddha-fields
there are, all of them the tathāgata knows.Even though, son of good family, one who want to reach awakening fills so ma
ny buddha-fields with seven kinds of precious jewels (saptaratna) giving them as a gift for the sake of awakening, if an
ybody grasps the true dharma and is established in such dharma of good qualities, then he who grasps the true dharma of 
one tathāgata will generate a lot more merit.Even though one honours, reveres, worships, adores and respects the buddhas
as numerous as mustards seeds, if anybody accepts the profound dharma (gambhīradharma), then he will generate a lot mor
e merit.Even though one makes endless offerings as numerous as mustard seeds, if anybody makes the seven steps (saptapad
a), taking pleasure in and enduring the dharma without any hostility towards all beings (sarvasatvāpratihatacitta), he w
ill generate a lot more merit.Even though one [accomplishes the works of] Indras, Brahmās, universal kings and bodhisatv
as (śakrabrahmacakravartirājabodhisatva) as numerous as mustard seeds, if anybody, who knows that all conditioned things
are impermanent and suffering (sarvaṃ saṃskṛtam anityaduḥkham), who understands that extinction is calm (śāntaṃ nirvāṇa
m), engenders the great compassion for all beings (satveṣu mahākaruṇotpadyate) and produces the thought of incomparable 
complete awakening for the sake of keeping the succession of the three jewels unbroken (triratnavaṃśasyānupacchedanārtha
ṃ), then he will generate a lot more merit.

VII. Transmission

Cāturmahārāja

Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, please give the tathāgata’s blessing over this ex
position of religion (dharmaparyāya) so that, in the latter time, in the latter age (paścimakāle paścimasamaye), it will
be disseminated and practiced throughout the Jambūdvīpa.”The Lord said: “For that reason, son of good family, I will in
voke the Four Great Kings (cāturmahārāja) so that they will come and strive to keep this exposition of religion for a lo
ng time (dharmaparyāyacirasthti) with detailed and analytical explanation (vistaravibhāganirdeśa).These are the words fo
r invoking: tadyathā | dhudhure | dhidhire | dhvajavati | dhvajālaṃkāre | āvartani | śame śamavati | śāntimukhe | nigrah
aparapakṣa | anuttara | uttaravigama | samapatha | pathaśuddhi | pathānugama | pathasandhi | prajñāmukhe | āryakule | bh

| dharmadhāraṇī |Son of good family, these are the words for invoking the Four Great Kings.”Then the Four Great Kings, 
having become scared and fearful (bhayabhīṭa), approached the Lord, prostrated themselves at the Lord’s feet, and said t
his to the Lord:“O Lord, we, the Four Great Kings will protect, shield, guard (rakṣāvaraṇagupti) this exposition of reli
gion (dharmaparyāya) so that it may last long and be beneficial.Wherever this exposition of religion is practiced, if th
ere are devas, nāgas, yakśas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas or kiṃnaras (devanāgayakṣagandharvāsuragaruḍakinnara) who want
the destruction of the dharma, we will subjugate them.Whosoever seek for the dharma, we will make them happy.We will of
fer hospitality to the congregation of the dharma-reciter (dharmabhāṇakaparṣanmaṇḍala), never forget the meaning of the 
words to be connected to the words (padānusaṃdhyasaṃpramoṣatā), give inspiration (pratibhāna), and increase recollection
, intelligence, understanding and happiness (smṛtimatiprativedhamuditā).At these words, the Lord said this to the Four G
reat Kings: “Excellent, excellent, friends, you are my sons born of the dharma, and all of you demonstrate the effort to
uphold my true dharma (saddharmaparigraha). With the outcome of the dharma (dharmaniṣyanda) all of you will be the mast
ers of the world in this world, and after having transcended all the world, you will attain the final extinction (nirvāṇ
a) in the realm of noble extinction (āryanirvāṇadhātu).”

Śakra Devānām Indra

Then the Lord said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, I will invoke Śakra, the lord of the gods (śa
kro devānām indraḥ), and by pronouncing the knowledge-mantra (vidyāmantra) he will remain for protecting this exposition
of religion (dharmaparyāya) so that it may last long. The mantra is as follows:tadyathā | śubhe | śubhamati | śubhavyūh
e | dudare |10 daride |11 duraṇi | dame śame | upaśame | khube | ugaśame | khabe | ugakhare | asomukhe | dhāraṇi | aradd
i | suśruṣe | sahite | abhede bhedadandhi saume samavati samarasmi | aśe | huhu | hehe | khurukhure | anatikrame | devar
akṣasahe he mahābhāvabhāsabrame | āgacchatu śakro devānāṃ | mantradaśaśatanayena12 | brahmakuṭadhāra | īśvara umarut bab
hana nivasi |Son of good family, these are the words for invoking the lord of gods by which he will be invoked and remai
n for this exposition of religion to last long.”Because of the impact of the dharma (dharmapravega), the lord of the god
s became full of happiness and all his dwelling places in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven were shaken. Then, together with many 
hundreds of thousands of attendant gods, he approached to the Lord, prostrated himself at the Lord’s feet, and said this
to the Lord:“O Lord, I am Śakra, the lord of gods, who have the mastery of the gods in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven. Togethe
r with a multitude of attendant gods, I will strive to disseminate this exposition of religion throughout the Jambūdvīpa
.I will never do violence to the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka) who retain this sūtra, delight in them, have faith in t
hem, and adorn them by adornments of the dharma. Wherever they teach this exposition of religion in a village (sagrāma),
city (nagara), town (nigama), kingdom (rāṣṭra) or capital (rājadhāni), I will protect, shield and guard them.O Lord, I 
will go to the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka) in order to listen the dharma (dharmaśravaṇa).[Even if someone] insults o
r abuses [the preachers of the dharma,] I will make him accept them.13I will protect, shield and guard them from the har
mful obstruction of Māra.”The Lord said: “Excellent, excellent, Kauśika, since you have obtained the power of gods, you,
having entered into the power of the dharma, will roar the lion’s road (siṃhanādanādi) in order to uphold all the buddh
a’s true dharma (saddharma).Why is that? Kauśika, if you uphold the true dharma of one tathāgata, then you are also upho
lding the true dharma of the Awakened Lords in the past, present and future (atītānāgatapratyutpanna).”

Brahmā Sahāṃpati

Then the Lord said to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Then, son of good family, I will invoke the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā (
brahmā sahāṃpati), and because of that he will continue protecting this exposition of religion. The words of invoking is
as follows:tadyathā | maitre | śubhamaitre | dharmamaitre | maitryānusahite samaitre | sandhimaitre | anugamamaitre | a
nugacchamaitre | anuttāramaitre | sātramaitre | dharmamaitre | anugrahamaitre | apratisārimaitre | ullalokanamaitre14 | 
vilokanamaitre | vilokanamaitre | bebhyaḥ anugamanamaitre | buddhādhiṣṭḥānamaitre | anurāgākṣamaitre | anurāgākṣamaitre 
| dharmapratisāraṇamaitre | mokṣamaitre | o no o no nur oṃ dhe | virodhamaitre | o to mo maitre | brahmapathamaitre | dh

mātikramabuddhādhiṣṭhānāṃ |Those treasuries of open space are the words of invoking the Brahā, the lord of Sahā.”Then th
e Brahmā, the lord of Sahā, dwelling in the heaven of Brahmā (brahmaloka), became aware of the presence of the buddha (b
uddhādhiṣṭhāna), heard these words of friendly mantra (maitrīmantra) by the power of the Buddha (buddhānubhāva), namely 
the sphere of divine hearing (divyaśrotradhātu), together with sixty-eight hundred thousand Brahmās, approached to the L
ord, prostrated himself at the Lord’s feet, and sat down on a side.Having sat down on a side, the Brahmā, the lord of Sa
hā, addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, since we are sustained by the presence of the tathāgata (tathāgatādhiṣṭhānād
hiṣṭhita), we will be endowed with friendliness and compassion (maitrīkaruṇā) and strive for this exposition of religion
.As for the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka), who, having collected this teaching of the buddha, understand it, retain it
, read it, teach it, and make it into a book (pustaka), wherever they hold religious discourses (dharmakathā) in the wil
derness (araṇya), forest (utpathamārga), village (sagrāma), city (nagara), town (nigama), kingdom (rāṣṭra) or capital (r
ājadhāni), if they explain this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) in detail, then we will protect them, shield them
, guard them, rejoice them, fulfill energy (bala), attain recollection (smṛti), acquire intelligence (mati), be accordan
ce with realization (prativedha), fulfill eloquence (pratibhāna), inspire the unbelieving with faith, and liberate those
who have faith. According to the tathāgata’s guiding principle of the dharma (tathāgatadharmanaya), Lord, we will uphol
d and disseminate it”At these words, the Lord said this to the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā: “Excellent, excellent, Brahmā, 
since you uphold the true dharma, the tathāgata rejoices in you.Just as I am turning the wheel of the dharma (dharmacakr
a), just so, Brahmā, you also will before long turn it.Just as you are upholding my true dharma, just so other Brahmās w
ill uphold your true dharma.”

Bodhisatva Maitreya

Then the Lord said this to the bodhisatva, the great being Maitreya: “O Maitreya, I entrust (parindāmi) you with this [te
aching of] incomparable complete awakening, which has been established for countless hundreds of millions of aeons, in o
rder that it will be memorized, understood, read, and elucidated in detail to others, in order to give thanks and gratit
ude to the tathāgata, fulfill my aspirations (abhiprāya), increase and purify many beings’ roots of good (kuśalamūla), m
ake the bodhisatvas attain the light of the dharma (dharmāloka), subjugate all Māras, defeat all heretics (tīrthika), up
hold the dharma of the highest meaning (paramārthadharma), and in order not to break the continuity of the three jewels 
(triratnavaṃśānupaccheda).”At these words, the bodhisatva Maitreya addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, I will protec
t this unexcelled treasury of the Dharma Jewel (anuttaradharmaratnanidhāna) for the sake of the complete extinction of t
he tathāgata (tathāgataparinirvāṇa).Why is that? Because, Lord, this is the true dharma (saddharma) of myself and the Aw
akened Lords in the past, present and future (atītānāgatapratyutpanna).O Lord, when I have dwelled in the Tuṣita Heaven 
(tuṣitabhavanastha), I have strived for protecting, upholding, and keeping these sūtras for a long time.O Lord, in the l
atter time, in the latter age (paścimakāle paścimasameye), if someone were to hear this true sūtra, grasp it, retain it,
recite it, fully explain it to others, and practice it himself, may you know that it is because of the sustaining power
of maitreya (maitreyādhiṣṭhāna).If, Lord, the partisans of the Māra were to attack, even further, if the root of goods 
were to fill up every pore of my whole body, and then if all living beings in the world system of three thousand worlds 
were to become the wicked Māras, they do not approach even a hundredth part of the root of goods in one of the pores and
so on, until nor do they approach even the likeness of it (ekaromakūpasya kuśalamūlaḥ śatatamīm api kalāṃ nopaiti yāvad
upamām api nopaiti).O Lord, as all regions of Māras (sarvamāramaṇḍala) were conquered by the power of my merits (puṇyab
ala) and the power of my knowledge (jñānabala), this awakening will be protected by the tathāgata for countless millions
.”The Lord said: “Good, good, Maitreya, these four are the bodhisatva’s actions. What four? 1) conquering all Māras and 
vices (sarvamārakleśanigraha); 2) defeating all opponents (sarvaparapravādin) in accordance with the dharma (dharmānulom
ikābhibhava); 3) bringing all beings to maturity (satvaparipācana); 4) upholding the true dharma (saddharmaparigraha).Th
ose four actions are belonging to one, namely, upholding the true dharma (saddharmaparigraha).”

Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda

Then the Lord said this to the elder Mahākāśyapa and the venerable Ānanda: “Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda, I entrust (parindāmi)
you with this [teaching of] incomparable complete awakening so that it will be memorized, understood, read and elucidat
ed to others.”The Mahākāśyapa said: “O Lord, we will uphold this awakening of the tathāgata with all my might.”The Ānand
a said: “O Lord, we will take up this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) and disseminate it by the presence of the t
athāgata (tathāgatādhiṣṭhāna).”

Bodhisatva Puṇyālaṃkāra

Then the bodhisatva, the great being Puṇyālaṃkāra addressed himself to the Lord:“O Lord, what the Lord had said (tathāgat
abhāṣita) in this sūtra is deep and profound in illumination, free from mental activity (pracāra), difficult to see its 
explicit meaning (nītārthadurdṛśya), difficult to understand (duradhigamya), endowed with the higher truth (paramārtha),
namely emptiness (śūnyatā), adorned with the adornment of morality (śīlālaṃkārālaṃkṛta), producing recollection (smṛti)
, concentration (samādhi), penetration (nirvedhika) and happiness in thought (manaspraharṣaṇa), illuminating the light o
f insight (prajñāraśmi), revealing liberation (vimukti), peaceful, unsullied, known by the wise and accomplished ones, p
raised and extolled by all buddhas (sarvabuddhasaṃstutapraśasta), sealed with the seal of the king of memory and sūtras 
(dhāraṇīsūtrāntarājamudrāmudrita), grasping the unhindered eloquence (apratihatapratibhānagrahaṇa), increasing recollect
ion, intelligence, understanding and confidence (smṛtimatiprativedhādhimuktivivardhana), not surpassed by any Māra or ad
versary (sarvamārapratyarthikānabhibhūta), rebuking immoral beings (duḥśīla), established in the dharma which is the qua
lities of purity, austerity, fulfilling vows and the qualities of giving (dhūtaguṇasaṃlekhasaṃvaraniryātatyāgaguṇadharma
pratiṣṭhita), and originated from endless good merits (anantaguṇadharmanirjāta). If sons of good family or daughters of 
good family were to bear this teaching and knowledge of all the buddhas in their minds, grasp it, retain it, read it, ma
ster it, elucidate it to others, write it, copy it, recite it, think about it, examine it, reflect on it, and be establi
shed in the progress (pratipattipratiṣṭhita), then how much merit (puṇya) they will generate?”Then the Lord spoke the fo
llowing verses to the bodhisatva Puṇyālaṃkāra:
