10. SaṃghānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection on the Saṃgha, which is authorized by the Lord for th
e sake of the bodhisatvas (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvasya saṃghānujñātā buddhānusmṛtiḥ)?.What we called the Saṃgha
is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), and it cannot to be recollected in the perspective of conditioning (abhisaṃskāra).Where t
here is no involvement (samudācāra) with the actions of body, speech or mind (kāyavāṅmanaskarma), it is called unconditi
oned (anabhisaṃskāra).Thus what we called conditioned (saṃskṛta) is a mere denomination (prajñapti) and convention (vyav
ahāra);The unconditioned (asaṃskṛta) is the destruction of all denominations (sarvaprajñaptisamudghāta), and the transce
ndence of all conventions (sarvavyavahārasamatikrānta).Son of good family, this is the recollection of the congregation,
which is authorized by the Lord.
