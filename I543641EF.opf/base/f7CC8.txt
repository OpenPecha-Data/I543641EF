Son of good family, the bodhisatvas have two types of vigour. What are these two? (dvāv imau kulaputra bodhisatvānāṃ vīry
e. katamau dvau?)Namely, the vigour of application (prayogavīrya) and the vigour of determination (paricchedavīrya).The 
vigour of application is connected with body, speech, and thought (tatra prayogavīryaṃ kāyavākcittapratisaṃyuktam).The v
igour of determination is without grasping, giving up, and its basis (utpādanotsargāvasthita).The vigour of application 
(prayogavīrya) which is connected with the bodhisatva’s body, speech, and thought (kāyavākcitta) cannot be perceived sin
ce it has no basis; the vigour of determination is in accordance with the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhāt
u).Thus the vigour of the bodhisatva becomes like empty space.
