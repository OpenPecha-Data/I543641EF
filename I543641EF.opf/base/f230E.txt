The great vehicle (mahāyāna) is made with four wheels (cakra), namely with the means of attraction (saṃgrahavastu),the sp
okes (ara) are well fitted as the roots of good (kuśalamūla) have been transformed (pariṇāmita) with intention (āśaya),i
t is well made with a deep nave (gambhīranābhi) as there is the immense knowledge of dependent origination (pratītyasamu
tpādajñāna),it is well kept together by the axle (akṣa) in order to bear the burdens of all living beings (sarvasatvabhā
ra),the pole (īṣā) is firmly fixed since it is supported by the great friendliness and great compassion (mahāmaitrīmahāk
aruṇa),it is surrounded with the railing (vedikā) of all sorts of jewels as it is adorned with all the jewels of dharma 
(sarvadharmaratnasamalaṃkṛta),it is fastened with a strong girth (varatra) of the highest intention (adhyāśaya) since it
surpasses one’s earlier promise (pūrvapratijñottaraka),it is carried on by a yoke (yugaṃdharavāhi) yoked with the team 
of insight and expedient means (prajñopāyayuganaddha),it is fastened in the holes of peaceful meditation and expanded vi
sion (śamathavipaśyanā),it is powered by the power of understanding four holy truths (catuḥsatyaparijñābala),it has the 
power of a thousand well-bred horses (ājanya),it goes to all buddha-fields (sarvabuddhakṣetra) by four magical feet (ṛdd
hipāda),the horns (śṛṅga) of recollection are bound with the string of a jewel necklace (ratnamālā),it roams widely and 
broadly since it contains all living beings,it fulfills its function (sukṛtakarma) as it subdues enemies (pratyarthika) 
and the Māras (mārapratyarthika),it is applied with (prayukta) practical knowledge and wisdom (vidyājñāna),it is driven 
by an autopilot (adhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhita),all buddhas in ten directions think of it,it is well adorned with a lion’s throne 
(siṃhāsana_samalaṃkṛta),is praised by all the gods, the king of the gods, and the highest god (sarvadevaśakrabrahmābhina
ndita),has good visual form that one never be satisfied with looking at (atṛptadarśana),is beautiful to behold (darśanīy
a),is unbreakable because it is firm as a diamond (vajradṛḍha),is unchangeable due to the promise (pratijñā) based on th
e firmness of the highest intention (sārādhyāśaya),is controlled and well-grasped by a charioteer (sārathi),is always le

f vows (praṇidhānaguṇaparipūrṇānugata),obtains the light (ālokalabdha) of divine sight in the great view of ten directio
ns (daśadigvilokitadivyacakṣur),has the pure and wide light of infinite rays (raśmi) so that it can illuminate the ten d
irections,is always filled with flowers because the rain of flowers (puṣpavarṣa), namely the limbs of awakening (bodhyaṅ
ga), continually pours down,is equipped with musical instruments which always produce the sound of dharma (dharmasvara),
is in accordance with the mental capacity of followers,strives for all practices of bodhisatva (sarvabodhisatvacaryāpary
eṣṭi),is superior because of infinite knowledge and immeasurable virtue (anantajñānaākāraguṇa),and is connected with the
knowledge of knowing everything that is emptiness endowed with all sorts of excellencies (sarvākāravaropetaśūnyatāsarva
jñajñānasamprayukta). Son of good family, the great vehicle (mahāyāna) is like that.Therefore, Good men (satpuruṣa), sin
ce the bodhisatva enters on the supramundane way (lokottaramārga) after having put on the armour, he appears to many bei
ngs, performing the deeds of the Buddha (buddhakārya), even without obtaining omniscience (sarvajñāna).”When this arrang
ement of way, armour, and vehicle was displayed, seventy-two thousand gods and human beings produced the thought of the 
incomparable complete awakening (iha mārgasaṃnāhayānavyūhe nirdiśyamāne dvisaptatīnāṃ prāṇidevamānuṣaṇām anuttarāyāṃ sam
yaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpāditāni),and thirty-two thousand bodhisatvas attained the tolerance that all things are unborn b
y purifying the supramundane way (dvātriṃśatīnāṃ ca bodhisatvasahasrāṇām lokottaramārgapariśuddhyā anutpattikadharmakṣān
tiḥ pratilabdhā).

Ratnaśrī

gaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 6Then the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good
family, was the supramunane way purified by you?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, it was purified by purifying my
self.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, how did you purify yourself?”Gaganagañja said: “Since this world is pure, son 
of good family, I am originally pure.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, what is the purity of the world?”Gaganagañja s
aid: “Since the form (rūpa) is originally pure, it is deathless (acyuta).Since the form in the future will be pure, it i
s without coming.Since the form in the present is pure, it is established in the true state (dharmatāsthita).In the same
way, since the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are originally pu
re, those are deathless.Since the consciousness (vijñāna) in the future will be pure, it is without coming.Since the con
sciousness in the present is pure, it is established in the true state (dharmatā). Son of good family, this is the purit
y of the world.”Ratnaśrī said: “As for the pure world, where can we see it?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, you c
an see such pure world in all dharmas.”Ratnaśrī said: “How can we see all the dharmas?"Gaganagañja said: “It is when we 
know how to distinguish the past and future of all dharmas by means of insight and knowledge (prajñājñāna)”Ratnaśrī said
: “How do you distinguish the past and future of all dharmas?”Gaganagañja said: “Where there is no cessation (pariccheda
) or eternity (śāśvata).”Ratnaśrī said: “Where is no cessation or eternity?”Gaganagañja said: “Where there is no cessati
on or eternity there is no origination or extinction (anutpannāniruddhatā).”Ratnaśrī said: “What is this place without o
rigination or extinction?”Gaganagañja said: “It cannot be verbally expressed.”Ratnaśrī said: “Why is that?”Gaganagañja s
aid: “Because the dharma is incalculable and ineffable.”Ratnaśrī: “Son of good family, how can you count the incalculabl
e dharmas (asaṃkhyeyadharma)?”Gaganagañja said: “Just as, even though on the earth it is possible to measure open space,
in open space it is impossible, just so, even though it is possible to measure by means of calculation (gaṇanamukhena),
it is still impossible to measure by means of calculation. This is because the nature of the means of calculation is no
n-calculation.”Ratnaśrī said: “What then are the means of calculation and the means without calculation?”Gaganagañja sai
d: “The means of calculation is conditioned (saṃskṛta), and the means without calculation is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta).T
herefore, that which is without calculation in the unconditioned is beyond calculation, and that which is beyond calcula
tion is unconditioned, thus the Lord said that by means of insight one should calculate, investigate, and give up what i
s to be given up.Accordingly, when the bodhisatva calculates the dharma in the conditioned, measures it in his conscious
ness, and reflects on it in the right way, he never sees any dharma which is to be fully known (parijñeya), to be elimin
ated (prahātavya), to be realized (sākṣātkartavya), or to be cultivated (bhāvayitavya).Since the bodhisatva never sees a
ny dharma, he does not establish any dharma.Where he does not establish any dharma, there is the attainment of the absen
ce of basis (anālaya).Where he attains the absence of basis, there is not anything to be wanted.Where there is nothing t
o be wanted, there is nothing to be obtained.Since he is free from mental conception (upalambha), there is nothing relat
ed to the self (amama) or nothing to be grasped (aparigraha).What is non-grasping? It is not grasping permanence or impe
rmanence in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna);it
is not grasping suffering or happiness in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness; 
it is not grasping the self or selflessness in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousne
ss;it is not grasping the beautiful or the ugly in from, as well as in [feeling, perception, formative factors or] consc
iousness; it is not grasping emptiness or non-emptiness in from, as well as in [feeling, perception, formative factors o
r] consciousness.Even though he does not grasp anything, he attains concentration (samādhi). He stays within existence (
saṃsāra), but he never grasps any vice of existence.Even though he makes living beings believe in extinction, he attaine
d extinction from the beginning (ādiparinirvṛta).What then is the extinction of the bodhisatva?Extinction (parinirvāṇa) 
is the unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta).Even though the bodhisatva never makes even a small bad action (akuśalakarman), he
still enters into grasping for the good actions (kuśaladharma).Since the bodhisatva makes all composite things (sarvasa
ṃskṛta) as belonging to body, speech, and mind (kāyavākcitta), he, having investigated them, transforms them into omnisc
ience.He does not seek omniscience as form nor feeling, nor perception, nor formative factors, nor consciousness.Because
he is not attached to his thoughts and morality, while fulfilling all his vows (sarvapraṇidhāna), he never sees (na sam
anupaśyati) the dharma in which there is increase or decrease.Since the dharma does not decrease nor increase, the bodhi
satva, having attained the sameness of all dharmas (sarvadharmasamatā), performs the practice of a bodhisatva, being est
ablished in the absolute reality (dharmadhātu), thus he neither performs nor practices any dharma.Son of good family, th
e bodhisatva who has attained such extinction performs the practice of the bodhisatva (bodhisatvacaryā).Why is that? Whe
n the bodhisatva is established in the unconditioned (abhisaṃskāra) among all constructed, he attains extinction, and th
erefore the bodhisatva does not construct things among all the constructed things. Thus the unconditioned is called ‘ext
inction (parinirvāṇa)’ because it is not conditioned.Since the other shore (pāra) is that which does not enter into cons
ciousness (vijñāna), the bodhisatva is characterized (prabhāvita) as having no conceptual activity (avijñapti), thus it 
is called ‘extinction.’Since the other shore is without distinguishing marks (animitta), the bodhisatva does not transfo
rm his thoughts into distinguishing marks, thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since the other shore is beyond false imaginat
ion (parikalpa), his thoughts do not enter into the imagination, thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since the other shore is
baseless, he does not transform his thoughts into the absence of basis (anālaya), thus it is called ‘extinction.’Theref
ore, son of good family, this is the extinction of the bodhisatva, namely performing the practice of the bodhisatva.Then
the Lord applauded the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (atha khalu bhagavān gaganagañjāya bodhisatvāya mahāsatv
āya sādhukāram adāt): “Well done, good man, well done (sādhu sādhu satpuruṣa). If it should be explained, I will say lik
e that.”When this teaching was declared, five hundred bodhisatvas produced the tolerance [that all things are unborn (an
utpattikadharmakṣānti)].Then the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, we atta
ined eloquence by this light of the dharma from the tathāgata (tathāgatadharmāloka).Just as forms appear in dependence o
n light, so we attained shining eloquence by the power generated by the tathāgata.”Then the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī said thi
s to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, why do you hide your knowledge and teach that you attained eloquen
ce by the presence of the Buddha (buddhādhiṣṭhāna)?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, all the eloquence of the bodh
isatvas, even a small part of it, should be seen as the presence of the Buddha. Why is that? If the buddhas do not make 
those dharmas appear, how could the bodhisatva attain eloquence?”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, how is the eloquenc
e transferred?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, there is no transference [of eloquence,] but, nevertheless, the el
oquence is attained by the eloquence of the Buddha.”Just as, even though ignorance (avidyā) is not transferred to the fo
rmative factors (saṃskāra), the formative factors are produced by the cause of ignorance, just so, even though the eloqu
ence of the Buddha is not transferred anywhere, by its cause the eloquence still arises.Just as the sounds of horses, el
ephants, and human beings (hayagajamanuṣyakāḥ śabdāḥ) are not transferred to an echo (pratiśrutkā) but because of it the
echo (pratiśrutkā) arises, just so the eloquence of the Buddha is not transferred anywhere but by its cause the eloquen
ce still arises.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda) is profound (gambhīra).”G
aganagañja said: “In the same way any dharma is never born.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, what is it that there is
no dependent origination of any dharma?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, if a certain agent (kartṛ) is in conditi
ons, the dharmas will be born, but, because any agent is not apprehended in conditions, the agent is not apprehended in 
any dharma.Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, what is it that the Tathāgata never appears?”Gaganagañja said: “if suchne
ss arises, the tathāgata will appear, but still we hold the view that suchness never arises. Why is that? Suchness is br
ought about (prabhāvita) through non-arising. One who understands all dharmas just like the suchness, he is called the t
athāgata.Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, why did the tathāgata come?”Gaganagañja said: “Something like that should b
e let alone (sthāpanīya).”Ratnaśrī said: “What is this letting alone?”Gaganagañja said: “Because the absolute truth (dha
rmadhātu) is in accordance with its proper place (yathāsthāna).”Ratnaśrī said: “What is the place of the absolute truth?
”Gaganagañja said: “It is not the place of birth nor the place of death, it is neither a place nor non-place. Such a pla
ce is the place of the absolute truth, and just the place of absolute truth is the place of all dharmas.The place of all
dharmas is not a place, and that which is not a place is without place because there is no place of birth or place of d
eath, thus it is neither a place nor non-place. Such is the place of the tathāgata which is not considered as the place 
of birth nor the place of cessation.In this way, son of good family, that the tathāgata appears is an extreme (eko ’ntaḥ
) and that the tathāgata never appears is another extreme, thus you should seek the tathāgata from the middle way (madhy
amapratipad) which is free from both extremes, namely the existence of birth or the non-existence of birth.”Ratnaśrī sai
d: “Son of good family, although that the buddha arises from the absence of the place of birth or death is profound, son
of good family, who would believe this appearing of the buddha?”Gaganagañja said: “One who does not make any matter of 
dispute (adhikaraṇa).”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, how is ‘matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa)’ explained?”Gaganagañja
said: “Son of good family, ‘matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa)’ is a word for imputing (samāropa).One who does not impute a
nything to any dharma does not makes any matter of dispute concerning any dharma, therefore a word for ‘no matter of dis
pute’ is a word for sameness (samatā);a word for sameness is a word for the incomparable (asadṛśa);a word for the incomp
arable is a word for the absence of words (apada);a word for the absence of words is a word for the absence of letters (
anakṣara);a word for the absence of letters is a word for the absence of information (avijñapti);a word for the absence 
of information, in which there is no activity (apracāra) of thoughts and mind (cittamanas), is a word for the absence of
activity;Just as, even though bird-tracks do not remain in the sky, we still talk about it with the place of sound, in 
the same way, whether the buddha is born or unborn, we still talk about it with the word to be born.In that case, even t
hough the bodhisatva teaches non-origination (anutpāda), he still makes things appear.Why is that? Because the essential
nature of all dharmas (sarvadharmasvabhāva) is the essential nature of unbornness (anutpādasavabhāva);the essential nat
ure of unbornness (anutpādasvabhāva) is without own nature (niḥsvabhāva);that which has no essential nature, in that the
re is no existence;that in which there is no existence, that is established nowhere, thus all dharmas are the limit esta
blished nowhere (apratiṣṭhitakoṭi);the limit established nowhere is the limit of all dharmas, thus all the dharmas are c
alled ‘being established in the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi)’;what is called the limit of reality is the unlimited limit
(aparicchinnakoṭi);since the limit is in accordance with all limits, all dharmas appear as having attained the limit.Wh
y is that? Because, even if the limit attains another part of the sky, it is still the same limit in the sky. Just as th
ere is no border dividing the sky, just so there is no limit of any dharma (sarvadharmakoṭi) in the limit of reality (bh
utakoṭi).Since the limit of reality is the limit of the self (ātmakoṭi), by knowing the limit of the self, the knowledge
of the limit of all beings is understood.Since the limit of all dharmas is unified with the limit of all beings, all dh
armas are called ‘the limit of exhaustion (kṣaya), the end of exhaustion, and the ultimate of exhaustion.’What is called
‘exhaustion (kṣaya)’ is a designation (adhivacana) for extinction (nirvāṇa), and thus all dharmas are the same as extin
ction.Why is that? Because it is without adversary (niṣpratipakṣa).Just as there is no adversary in open space, so there
is no adversary in all dharmas.Those who seek extinction (nirvāṇa) in the perspective of an adversary see birth and dea
th, and those who think that these dharmas will be born and will die never know the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamat
ā) since they practice in birth and death.Therefore, the Lord said “You should know! you should know! Do not dispute! Do
not dispute! Fulfill the indisputable excellent qualities of ascetics (śrāmaṇa)!”

Ānanda

At that time, the venerable Ānanda addressed himself to the Lord (atha khalu āyuṣman ānando bhagavantam etad avocat):“It 
is a marvelous thing, Lord, just as the bodhisatva Gaganagañja manifests his body, just so he teaches us.”The bodhisatva
Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Ānanda, my body is manifested though, it is not manifested by myself.Why is that? Because 
open space is my body, it is manifested.”Ānanda said: “How then is your body manifested?”Gaganagañja said: “This is beca
use, even though the buddha’s work (buddhakṛtya) is done by the body, the true body (dharmakāya), which is not undefiled
, is not brought about through the parts of personality, spheres or fields of perception (skandhadhātvāyatana), nor born
of the inverted body (viparyayakāya), but obtained by the mental body (manaskāya). In this way, the bodhisatva’s body i
s manifested.”Ānanda said: “Son of good family, are you manifesting all dharmas?”Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Ānanda, on
e should not think of my body separated from the dharma, it is the dharma itself, and the dharma itself is my body, in t
his way I manifest my body.”Ānanda said: “Son of good family, if you manifested your body, are you an Arhat?”Gaganagañja
said: “Having penetrated the entrance into the dharma which is free from impurity (araṇādharmamukhaprativedha), without
desire (rāga), I do not have any aversion or bewilderment (dveṣamoha), thus I am an Arhat.”Ānanda said: “Son of good fa
mily, if you are a Worthy One, when did you reach complete extinction (parinirvāṇa)?”Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Ānanda
, an Arhat does not reach extinction, and ordinary people (pṛthagjanā) are not Arhats who reach extinction.Why is that? 
Because an Arhat gives up the concept of extinction (nirvāṇasaṃjñā).Since ordinary people just produce the thought-const
ructions of extinction, to the extent that they made thought-constructions do they reach extinction.”Ānanda said: “Accor
ding to our interpretation of what you said, son of good family, you are not an Arhat, ordinary man (pṛthagjana), one wh
o is undergoing training (śaikṣa), one who no longer needs training (aśaikṣa), isolated buddha, bodisatva, or tathāgata.
”Gaganagañja said: “Good, Ānanda, very good. Even though the bodhisatva, who is not an Arhat, ordinary man (pṛthagjana),
one who is undergoing training (śaikṣa), one who no longer needs training (aśaikṣa), isolated buddha, bodisatva, or tat
hāgata, teaches every stage (sarvabhūmi), he is still not established in any place.”When this teaching was declared, in 
order to protect the dharma, five hundred disciples, immediately offering dharma-robes to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, sa
id: “May all living beings attain eloquence such as this (sarvasatvā īdṛśasya pratibhānasya lābhino bhavantu)!”Then, by 
the magical presence of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, the dharma-robes disappeared into open space.Then those monks, the W
orthy Ones, said: “Son of good family, where did the dharma-robes go?”Gaganagañja said: “They went into the treasury of 
open space.”Then the Lord smiled (atha khalu bhagavān smitaṃ prādurakarot), and the venerable Ānanda asked the meaning o
f smiling: “O Lord, as the tathāgata does not smile for no reason, what is the reason for smiling?”The Lord said: “Ānand
a, the bodhisatva Gaganagañja received five hundred robes by those five hundred monks, put them into the treasury of ope
n space, sprinkled on the world-sphere called Kāṣāyadhvaja. In this way he performed the buddha-activities (buddhakārya)
in the buddha-field of the tathāgata Parvatarāja. Then the religious discourses given by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja aro
se from those dharma-robes in the buddha-field, and hundreds koṭis of bodhisatvas attained the tolerance [that all thing
s are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti)] by the teaching of the dharma.Ānanda, you should see the sphere of supernatural 
power and knowledge (ṛddhijñānaviṣaya) of the bodhisatva in order to bring various living beings to maturity (anekaparyā
yasatvaparipācana).When this teaching was taught, the great rain of flowers, which have been never seen before, shining 
brilliantly like the radiant sun and moon (candrasūrya), poured down, and a voice resonated from those flowers: “Having 
heard this teaching of the bodhisatva Gaganagñja, those living beings with faith, being sealed with the irreversible sea
l (avaivartikamudrā), will be devoted themselves to the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa).”Ānanda said: “O Lord, where are
these flowers coming from?”The Lord said: “Ānanda, the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha, who reigned over one hundred thousand world-
spheres, sprinkled these flowers in order to worship (pūjākarmaṇa) the bodhisatva Gaganagañja.”Ānanda said: “O Lord, we 
would like to see him.”The Lord said: “Just wait a minute, Ānanda, you will see him soon.”

Prabhāvyūha

At that time, the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha, being surrounded and followed (parivṛta) by sixty-eight hundred thousand Brahmās, t
eleported from the world of Brahmā to the presence of the Lord (brahmaloke antarhitaḥ bhagavato ’ntike prātiṣṭhata), bow
ed down at his feet (bhagavataḥ pādau śirobhir vanditvā), circumambulated him three times (tripradakṣiṇīkṛṭya), and sat 
down on a side.Then the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, the greatness (māhātmya) of the bodhi
satva Gaganagañja’s morality, concentration, supernormal knowledge, knowledge, insight, fulfilling vows, skillful means,
highest intention, mastery of the dharma, ornaments for body, speech and thought, and mastery over all dharmas (śīlasam
ādhyabhijñājñānaprajñāpraṇidhānaparipūraṇopāyakauśalādhyāśayadharmeśvarakāyavākcittālaṃkārasarvadharmavaśitā) are marvel
ous (āścarya)!Since the bodhisatva Gaganagañja has purified his former activities, he manifests all activities by body, 
speech, and thought without any effort. O Lord, since his former roots of good (pūrvakuśalamūla) have been not yet repai
d by anyone, that the bodhisatva Gaganagañja roars this lion’s roar (siṃhanādanādi) in the present time is the outcome o
f the profound practice in the past.”The Lord said: “Quite so, it is just as you have said. The incomparable complete aw
akening of the bodhisatvas arises from the former roots of good, merits, and knowledges (pūrvakuśalamūlapuṇyajñāna).”The
n the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha said this to the Lord: “O Lord, what is the root of good of the bodhisatvas, what is the merit,
what is the knowledge?”The Lord said: “Brahmā, ‘the root of good (kuśalamūla)’ is the initial resolution to strive for 
awakening (prathamacittotpādika), and the root of all qualities of the buddha (sarvabuddhadharmamūla);‘merit (puṇya)’ is
, as soon as the thought of awakening is produced, to conquer all items of meritorious action consisting in generosity, 
morality, and meditational self-cultivation of all disciples and isolated buddhas (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddhānāṃ dānamay
aṃ śīlamayaṃ bhāvanāmayaṃ sarvapunyakriyāvastvabhibhāvana);‘knowledge (jñāna)’ is to accumulate the root of good, and to
transform the accumulations into omniscience (sarvākārajñatā).Further, ‘the root of good’ is pure intention (śuddhāśaya
) since it is without deception or guile (māyāśāṭhya), ‘merit’ is the practice (prayoga) for all merits, etc., and ‘know
ledge’ is the highest intention (adhyāśaya) of going to a different state (viśeṣagamana).Further, ‘the root of good’ is 
the solemn vow of good teachings (kuśaladharma), ‘merit’ is never being content (asaṃtuṣṭi) with the accumulation of the
roots of good, and ‘knowledge’ is to consider the roots of good as an illusion.Further, ‘the root of good’ is to have s
piritual friends (kalyāṇamitra), ‘merit’ is not abandoning spiritual friends (kalyāṇamitrāparityāga), and ‘knowledge’ is
asking questions to spiritual friends.Further, ‘the root of good’ is aiming at the dharma (dharmārthika), ‘merit’ is st
riving for the dharma (dharmakāma), and ‘knowledge’ is taking pleasure in the delights of the dharma (dharmārāmaratirata
).Further, ‘the root of good’ is seeking the dharma (dharmaparyeṣṭi), ‘merit’ is teaching the dharma without a view to p
rofit (nirāmiṣadharmadeśaka), and ‘knowledge’ is without secrecy of teachers concerning religion (dharme ’nācāryamuṣṭi).
Further, ‘the root of good’ is listening to the dharma (dharmaśravaṇa), ‘merit’ is thorough reflection (yoniśaḥpratisaṃk
hyāna), and ‘knowledge’ is accomplishing the dharma (dharmanirhāra).Further, ‘the root of good’ is seeing the buddha (bu
ddhadarśana), ‘merit’ is worshiping the buddha, and ‘knowledge’ is relying on the buddha.Further, ‘the root of merit’ is
to become a renunciant, ‘merit’ is to be pleased with the [fourfold] sources of holiness (āryavaṃśa), and ‘knowledge’ i
s to be pleased in hermits (araṇyavāsa).Further, ‘the root of good’ is being easily satisfied with food (subharasupoṣatā
), ‘merit’ is effortlessly obtaining dhrama-robes and alms-bowls (cīvarapiṇḍapāta), and ‘knowledge’ is to usufruct (pari
bhoga) them without desire or greed.Further, ‘the root of good’ is to practice the presences of recollection (smṛtyupast
hāna), ‘merit’ is fulfilling the correct eliminations (samyakprahāṇaparipūraṇa), ‘knowledge’ is attaining the bases of m
agical power (ṛddhipāda).Further, ‘the root of good’ is the entrance into the ability of faith (śraddhendriya), ‘merit’ 
is in accordance with vigour, recollection, and awareness (vīrya_smṛtisaṃprajanya), and ‘knowledge’ is the cultivation o
f concentration and insight (samādhiprajñā).Further, ‘the root of good’ is to be established in the five powers (pañcaba
la), ‘merit’ is to understand the limbs of awakening (bodhyaṅga), and ‘knowledge’ is to know the entrance into the path

ning (bodhim abhisaṃbudh-) through insight that is associated with a moment of thought (ekacittakṣaṇasamāyuktaprajñā).In
this way, Brahmā, the bodhisatva arises from the root of good, merit, and knowledge (kuśalamūlapuṇyajñāna).”Then the Br
ahmā Prabhāvyūha said this to the Lord: “It is a marvelous, Lord, that the tathāgata explains all sorts of qualities of 
the buddha (sarvabuddhadharmanānātva) by means of these three root words [or stages] (mūlapada).”At these words, the bod
hisatva Gaganagañja said to the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha: “Brahmā, everything is included in a single word (ekapadasamavasṛta)
.Why is that? The word ‘emptiness (śūnyatā)’ is a single word, and everything is included in emptiness;the word ‘signles
sness (ānimitta)’ is a single word, and everything is included in signlessness;the word ‘wishlessness (apraṇihita)’ is a
single word, and everything is included in wishlessness;in the same manner, the words ‘the unconditioned (anabhisaṃskār
a), non-desire (virāga), peace (śānti), non-basis (anālaya), the absolute truth (dharmadhātu), suchness (tathatā), the l
imit of reality (bhūtakoṭi), inexistence (asaṃbhava), and unbornness (anutpāda), each of them is a single word, [and eve
rything is included in them];the word ‘extinction (nirvāṇa)’ is a single word, and everything is included in extinction.
Further, Brahmā, desire (rāga) is a word for non-desire. Why? Because desire is the essence of non-desire (virāgasvabhāv
a). Thus everything is included in the essence of desire (rāgasvabhāva).Aversion (dveṣa) is a word for non-aversion (adv
eṣa). Why? Because aversion is the essence of non- aversion (aveṣasvabhāva). Thus everything is the essence of aversion.
Bewilderment (moha) is a word for non-bewilderment (amoha). Why? Because bewilderment is the essence of non-bewilderment
(amohasvabhāva). Thus everything is the essence of bewilderment.Aggregation of perishable things (satkāya) is a word fo
r no aggregation of perishable things. Why? Because aggregation of perishable things is the essence of no aggregation of
perishable things. Thus everything is the essence of aggregation of perishable things.Form (rūpa) is a word for the abs
ence of form. Why? Because form is the essence of absence of form. Thus everything is the essence of form.In the same wa
y, feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are words for the absence of f
eeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness. Why? Because feeling, perception, formative factors and consciou
sness are the essence of absence of them. Thus everything is the essence of feeling, perception, formative factors and c
onsciousness.It is the same for fields, sense perceptions (dhātvāyatana), and the twelve links of dependent origination 
(dvādaśāṅga pratītyasamutpāda).Ignorance (avidyā) is a word for the absence of ignorance. Why? Because ignorance is the 
essence of the absence of ignorance, all dharmas of the buddha are the essence of ignorance.Birth is a word for no birth
(anutpāda). Why? Because birth is the essence of no birth, all dharmas of the buddha are the essence of birth.All teach
ings of the buddha (sarvabuddhadharma) is a word for no teaching (adharma). Why? Because everything is the essence of no
thought-construction (avikalpa), all teachings of the buddha are the essence of all teachings.Brahmā, those are the doo
r of entering into a word for dharma called (dharmapada) ‘the entrance into the word without word (apadapadapraveśa)’ in
which all dharmas of the buddha are included in one single word.Just as, Brahmā, all streams flow into the great ocean 
(mahāsāgara), just so all qualities of the buddha are included in a single word ‘the entrance into the dharma (dharmamuk
ha).’Just as, Brahmā, all manifestations of forms (sarvarūpāvabhāsa) appear in open space, just so all teachings of the 
buddha are included in a single word, thus this word is the inexhaustible word and the word which is split into one hund
red thousand.Just as, Brahmā, even though all of one hundred thousand are included in a single word which is split into 
one hundred thousand, and even though those have been removed after having been split for a thousand years, the muchness
of one hundred thousand is neither established in the connection with that word nor connected to ‘one hundred thousand,
’ just so, Brahmā, while calculating and measuring to split the qualities of the buddha for many hundreds of thousands o
f aeons, the qualities of the buddha are never experienced by body or thought, thus those are impossible to be explained
and too much to be explained.Further, muchness is non-muchness. Why is that? If someone obtained so much or not so much
, it would be just as much as he obtained because there is no muchness or non-muchness. Thus it is impossible to say tha
t it is much or not much.Brahmā, calculating the dharmas of the buddha is calculating all dharmas. Why is that? Because 
all dharmas are the dharmas of the buddha, and the dharmas of the buddha are neither the dharmas nor non-dharmas.Why is 
that? The dharmas of the buddha cannot be mentally constructed (parikalpita) by perception (saṃjñā), or rather, those ar
e taught in order to fully know the perception. Thus the thought-construction (parikalpa) that there is neither percepti
on nor non-perception is neither the dharma nor the non-dharma.Brahmā, since the dharmas of the buddha have such an esse
ntial character (lakṣaṇa), by their own essential character, they are pure and transcendent (svalakṣaṇapariśuddhasvalakṣ
aṇavivikta).Since own essential character (svalakṣaṇa) is the absence of essential character (alakṣaṇa), the open space 
has no essential character and it is characterized as all dharmas.When this religious discourse was given by the bodhisa
tva Gaganagañja, twelve thousand Brahmās in the assembly produced the thought of the incomparable complete awakening, an
d five thousand Brahmās, who had planted the well prepared roots of good (parikarmāvaropitakuśalamūla), attained the tol
erance that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti).
