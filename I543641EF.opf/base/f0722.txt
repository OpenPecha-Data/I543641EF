26. DṛḍavajrāśayaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva with a resolve firm and unbrekable (dṛḍhābhedyāśaya) l
ike the diamond (yathāvajra) become well established (susthita) and unwavering (aniñjya) in this great way?Son of good f
amily, when the bodhisatva is unbreakable (abhedya) having made a resolve as firm as a diamond with the twelve qualities
, he is not disturbed by the world with its gods (sadevakena lokena). What are those twelve (katamāni dvādaśa)?To wit, a
) since the thought of awakening (bodhicitta), intention (āśaya), and determination (adhyāśaya) are unbreakable (abhedya
), the practice (prayoga) is also unbreakable;b) the generosity (dāna) is unbreakable, and the morality, tolerance, vigo
ur, meditation, and insight (dānaśīlakṣāntivīryadhyānaprajñā) are unbreakable;c) great friendliness (mahāmaitrī) and gre
at compassion (mahākaruṇa) are unbreakable;d) the way of attraction (saṃgrahavastu) is unbreakable;e) bringing living be
ings to maturity (satvaparipācana) is unbreakable;f) the purification of the Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetrapariśuddhi) is u
nbreakable;g) indefatigability in existence (saṃsārāparikheda) is unbreakable;f) non-satisfaction for the root of good (
kuśalamūlātṛpti) is unbreakable;g) endless offerings (atyantayajña) for the sake of obtaining the characteristics of a g
reat man and the marks of beauty (lakṣaṇānuvyañjana) are unbreakable;h) giving up body and life in order to uphold the t
rue religion (saddharmaparigrahāya kāyajīvitaparityāgaḥ) is unbreakable;i) dedicating his roots of good (kuśalamūlapariṇ
āmana) for the sake of other beings (parasatvapudgala) is unbreakable;j) his accumulation of all qualities of the Buddha
(sarvabuddhadharmasamudānaya) is unbreakable.When the qualities of bodhisatva are unbreakable in that way, son of good 
family, he is unbreakable having made a resolve as firm as a diamond (dṛḍhavajrāśaya).Just as a diamond (maṇiratnavajra)
breaks any kind of gem without being broken itself, so the bodhisatva, having made a resolve as firm as a diamond, remo
ves bad habits, manifestations of vices, and wrong views (anuśayakleśaparyutthānadṛṣṭigata) of all living beings, but st
ill he himself is not broken because of this great vehicle (mahāyāna).In this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva is
unbreakable having made a resolves as firm as a diamond, being well established and unshakable in this great way.
