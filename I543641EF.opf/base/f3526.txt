Then the bodhisatva, the great being named Pradīpapāṇi came and sat down in this assembly, and addressed himself to the L
ord (atha khalu pradīpapāṇir nāma bodhisatvo mahāsatvo tatraiva pariṣadi sannipatito ’bhūt sanniṣaṇṇo bhagavantam etad a
vocat):“O Lord, which bodhisatva becomes one who gives away in this way? (ko bhagavan bodhisatva evaṃparityāgo bhavati)?
”The Lord said (bhagavān āha): “Son of good family (kulaputra), the bodhisatvas, the great beings who are beyond forms (
nirākāra) because they are pure of form (ākāraviśuddha);who have the appearance of living beings (satvākāra) because [th
ey see] the purity of living beings (satvaviśuddhi);who have the appearance of the dharma (dharmākāra) because [they see
] the purity of the dharma (dharmaviśuddhi);who have the appearance of knowledge (jñānākāra) because [they see] the puri
ty of knowledge (jñānaviśuddhi);who have the appearance of insight (prajñākāra) because [they see] the purity of insight
(prajñāviśuddhi);who have the appearance of thought (cittākāra) because [they see] the purity of consciousness (cittavi
śuddhi);who have the appearance of the world (lokākāra) because [they see] the purity of the world (lokaviśuddhi);who ar
e formless but manifest themselves in form (rūpa); whose wisdom of non-manifestation is pure;who are beyond darkness (an
dhakāra) because they illuminate darkness;who reached to the limit of distinguishing marks (nimittaparyanta) by the anni
hilation of all distinguishing marks (sarvanimittavināśa);who purified their knowledge which reached to its limit (niṣṭh
āgatajānaviśudda);who are endowed with inexhaustible patience (akṣayakṣamāvat);who have attained the prediction (vyākara
ṇa) that they will understand the knowledge of the Tathāgata (tathāgatajñāna);who have set the boundary [for practice] (
sīmābandha) and entered into the state of being determined as a bodhisatva (bodhisatvaniyāmāvakranti);who have attained 
the consecration (abhiṣekapratilambha) as sealed with the seal of non-retrogression (avinivartanamudrāmudrita);being on 
the way to attain all qualities of the Buddha, who practice with universal sameness (sarvabuddhadarmasaṃprasthitāḥ samat
ayā samācaranti)and have practiced good deeds (sucarita).This is the range of the bodhisatvas, the great beings who know
the way and characteristics of the behaviour of all living beings (sa sarvasatvacaritalakṣaṇavidhijñānāṃ bodhsatvānāṃ m
āhāsatvānāṃ gocaraḥ),and those good men give a gift in such a way (te satpuruṣā evaṃ dānaṃ dadati).When this teaching ha
d been declared (iha nirdeśe nirdiśyamāne), sixteen thousand bodhisatvas attained the tolerance [that all things are unb
orn (anutpattikadharmakṣāntipratilabdha)] in the sky-like giving (gaganasamadāna).Then, the Lord went on to speak these 
verses (atha khalu bhagavāṃs tasyāṃ velāyāṃ imā gāthā abhāṣata).
