Prabhāvyūha

At that time, the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha, being surrounded and followed (parivṛta) by sixty-eight hundred thousand Brahmās, t
eleported from the world of Brahmā to the presence of the Lord (brahmaloke antarhitaḥ bhagavato ’ntike prātiṣṭhata), bow
ed down at his feet (bhagavataḥ pādau śirobhir vanditvā), circumambulated him three times (tripradakṣiṇīkṛṭya), and sat 
down on a side.Then the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, the greatness (māhātmya) of the bodhi
satva Gaganagañja’s morality, concentration, supernormal knowledge, knowledge, insight, fulfilling vows, skillful means,
highest intention, mastery of the dharma, ornaments for body, speech and thought, and mastery over all dharmas (śīlasam
ādhyabhijñājñānaprajñāpraṇidhānaparipūraṇopāyakauśalādhyāśayadharmeśvarakāyavākcittālaṃkārasarvadharmavaśitā) are marvel
ous (āścarya)!Since the bodhisatva Gaganagañja has purified his former activities, he manifests all activities by body, 
speech, and thought without any effort. O Lord, since his former roots of good (pūrvakuśalamūla) have been not yet repai
d by anyone, that the bodhisatva Gaganagañja roars this lion’s roar (siṃhanādanādi) in the present time is the outcome o
f the profound practice in the past.”The Lord said: “Quite so, it is just as you have said. The incomparable complete aw
akening of the bodhisatvas arises from the former roots of good, merits, and knowledges (pūrvakuśalamūlapuṇyajñāna).”The
n the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha said this to the Lord: “O Lord, what is the root of good of the bodhisatvas, what is the merit,
what is the knowledge?”The Lord said: “Brahmā, ‘the root of good (kuśalamūla)’ is the initial resolution to strive for 
awakening (prathamacittotpādika), and the root of all qualities of the buddha (sarvabuddhadharmamūla);‘merit (puṇya)’ is
, as soon as the thought of awakening is produced, to conquer all items of meritorious action consisting in generosity,

this way, Brahmā, the bodhisatva arises from the root of good, merit, and knowledge (kuśalamūlapuṇyajñāna).”Then the Br
ahmā Prabhāvyūha said this to the Lord: “It is a marvelous, Lord, that the tathāgata explains all sorts of qualities of 
the buddha (sarvabuddhadharmanānātva) by means of these three root words [or stages] (mūlapada).”At these words, the bod
hisatva Gaganagañja said to the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha: “Brahmā, everything is included in a single word (ekapadasamavasṛta)
.Why is that? The word ‘emptiness (śūnyatā)’ is a single word, and everything is included in emptiness;the word ‘signles
sness (ānimitta)’ is a single word, and everything is included in signlessness;the word ‘wishlessness (apraṇihita)’ is a
single word, and everything is included in wishlessness;in the same manner, the words ‘the unconditioned (anabhisaṃskār
a), non-desire (virāga), peace (śānti), non-basis (anālaya), the absolute truth (dharmadhātu), suchness (tathatā), the l
imit of reality (bhūtakoṭi), inexistence (asaṃbhava), and unbornness (anutpāda), each of them is a single word, [and eve
rything is included in them];the word ‘extinction (nirvāṇa)’ is a single word, and everything is included in extinction.
Further, Brahmā, desire (rāga) is a word for non-desire. Why? Because desire is the essence of non-desire (virāgasvabhāv
a). Thus everything is included in the essence of desire (rāgasvabhāva).Aversion (dveṣa) is a word for non-aversion (adv
eṣa). Why? Because aversion is the essence of non- aversion (aveṣasvabhāva). Thus everything is the essence of aversion.
Bewilderment (moha) is a word for non-bewilderment (amoha). Why? Because bewilderment is the essence of non-bewilderment
(amohasvabhāva). Thus everything is the essence of bewilderment.Aggregation of perishable things (satkāya) is a word fo
r no aggregation of perishable things. Why? Because aggregation of perishable things is the essence of no aggregation of
perishable things. Thus everything is the essence of aggregation of perishable things.Form (rūpa) is a word for the abs
ence of form. Why? Because form is the essence of absence of form. Thus everything is the essence of form.In the same wa
y, feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are words for the absence of f
eeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness. Why? Because feeling, perception, formative factors and consciou
sness are the essence of absence of them. Thus everything is the essence of feeling, perception, formative factors and c
onsciousness.It is the same for fields, sense perceptions (dhātvāyatana), and the twelve links of dependent origination 
(dvādaśāṅga pratītyasamutpāda).Ignorance (avidyā) is a word for the absence of ignorance. Why? Because ignorance is the 
essence of the absence of ignorance, all dharmas of the buddha are the essence of ignorance.Birth is a word for no birth
(anutpāda). Why? Because birth is the essence of no birth, all dharmas of the buddha are the essence of birth.All teach
ings of the buddha (sarvabuddhadharma) is a word for no teaching (adharma). Why? Because everything is the essence of no
thought-construction (avikalpa), all teachings of the buddha are the essence of all teachings.Brahmā, those are the doo
r of entering into a word for dharma called (dharmapada) ‘the entrance into the word without word (apadapadapraveśa)’ in
which all dharmas of the buddha are included in one single word.Just as, Brahmā, all streams flow into the great ocean 
(mahāsāgara), just so all qualities of the buddha are included in a single word ‘the entrance into the dharma (dharmamuk
ha).’Just as, Brahmā, all manifestations of forms (sarvarūpāvabhāsa) appear in open space, just so all teachings of the 
buddha are included in a single word, thus this word is the inexhaustible word and the word which is split into one hund
red thousand.Just as, Brahmā, even though all of one hundred thousand are included in a single word which is split into 
one hundred thousand, and even though those have been removed after having been split for a thousand years, the muchness
of one hundred thousand is neither established in the connection with that word nor connected to ‘one hundred thousand,
’ just so, Brahmā, while calculating and measuring to split the qualities of the buddha for many hundreds of thousands o
f aeons, the qualities of the buddha are never experienced by body or thought, thus those are impossible to be explained
and too much to be explained.Further, muchness is non-muchness. Why is that? If someone obtained so much or not so much
, it would be just as much as he obtained because there is no muchness or non-muchness. Thus it is impossible to say tha
t it is much or not much.Brahmā, calculating the dharmas of the buddha is calculating all dharmas. Why is that? Because 
all dharmas are the dharmas of the buddha, and the dharmas of the buddha are neither the dharmas nor non-dharmas.Why is 
that? The dharmas of the buddha cannot be mentally constructed (parikalpita) by perception (saṃjñā), or rather, those ar
e taught in order to fully know the perception. Thus the thought-construction (parikalpa) that there is neither percepti
on nor non-perception is neither the dharma nor the non-dharma.Brahmā, since the dharmas of the buddha have such an esse
ntial character (lakṣaṇa), by their own essential character, they are pure and transcendent (svalakṣaṇapariśuddhasvalakṣ
aṇavivikta).Since own essential character (svalakṣaṇa) is the absence of essential character (alakṣaṇa), the open space 
has no essential character and it is characterized as all dharmas.When this religious discourse was given by the bodhisa
tva Gaganagañja, twelve thousand Brahmās in the assembly produced the thought of the incomparable complete awakening, an
d five thousand Brahmās, who had planted the well prepared roots of good (parikarmāvaropitakuśalamūla), attained the tol
erance that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti).
