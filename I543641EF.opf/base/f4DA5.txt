dhiṣṭhita) the display of appearances (avabhāsa) like this.O Śāriputra, the bodhisatva, the great being, Gaganagañja is 
coming here to see, praise, serve (darśanavandanaparyupāsana) me, and attain this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya)
, a chapter of the Great Collection (mahāsaṃnipātaparivarta). Also he is coming with the assembly of all bodhisatvas who
have gathered from the worlds of the ten directions (daśadiglokadhātu) for the sake of the joy of religion (dharmaprītā
), happiness (sukha), the source of great joy (prāmodyasamudaya), the upholding of the great vehicle (parigrahamahāyana)
, and the wings of awakening (bodhipakṣika) of all bodhisatvas.[In the Mahāvyūha universe, just after,] the bodhisatva, 
the great being Gaganagañja, accompanied by, encircled (parivṛta) and followed (puraskṛta) by twelve koṭis of bodhisatva
s, said to the tathāgata Ekaratnavyūha: “I would like to go to the world Sahā to honour the Buddha Śākyamuni. I wish to 
see him and listen to him. Then that Buddha said: “I will grant your wish.” The bodhisatva Gaganagañja touched the feet 
of the Buddha Ekaratnavyūha, and circumambulated him.Then, by the supernatural display (ṛddhyabhisaṃskāra), by the mirac
ulous performances (vikrīḍita) of the [Ekaratnavyūha] Buddha, [Gaganagañja with the other bodhisatvas] teleported from t
he Mahāvyūha universe to this Saha universe (mahāvyūhalokadhātau antarhitaḥ sahālokadhātau prātiṣṭhata), in one moment o
f thought (ekacittakaṣana), and sat down there.They showered flowers, garlands, powders, perfumes, unguents, parasols, b
anners, flags (puṣpamālyacūrṇagandhavilepanacchatradhvajapatākā) from the Mahāvyūha universe pouring down as rain (varṣā
bhipravarṣaka).To wit, the moon flower, the great moon flower, the most beautiful moon flower, the sun-light flower (sūr
yaprabha), the sun-shining flower, the sun-loved flower (sūryakānta) flower, the fair-colored flower (roca), the great f
air-colored flower (mahāroca), the brightening-colored flower, the Sthāla flower (sthāla), the great Sthāla flower (mahā
sthāla), the beautiful Sthāla flower, the undefiled flower, the impeccable flower, the pure-light flower, the golden-lig
ht flower, the space-light flower, the tangible flower, the white great fragrance flower, the non-anther flower, the Aśo
ka flower (aśoka), the Cadamba flower (nandaka), the golden bark tree flower, the source of happiness flower, the satisf
action of body and mind flower, the one billion fragrances flower, the herbal flower, and the medicinal flower.[The flow
ers] were adorned with their own splendor and were and produced by immeasurable merits (aprameyapuṇya) and known by bodh
isatvas of the ten directions. The great three-thousand thousands of worlds were covered (saṃchādayati) with those flowe
rs, and all congregations of the Lord were filled with flowers up to their knees (puṣpajānumātra).Then the whole assembl
y (sarvāvatī parṣat), having seen the flowers which have never seen or heard before (adṛṣṭāśrutapūrva), addressed themse
lves to the Lord:"O Lord, where are such beautiful flowers coming from? (kuto bhagavann imāni evaṃrūpāṇi darśanīyāni puṣ
pāṇi āgacchanti)"The Lord said (bhagavān āha), “O son of good family (kulaputra), the bodhisatva, the great being, Gagan
agañja, having come from the Mahāvyūha universe, brought down such rain of flowers (puṣpavarṣa).”Then the bodhisatva, th
e great being Gaganagañja together with the twelve koṭis of bodhisatvas, having descended from the vault of the sky, bow
ed down at the feet of the Buddha, circumambulated him three times, and addressed himself to the Lord. (atha gaganagañjo
bodhisatvo mahāsatvas tābhir dvādaśair bodhisatvakoṭibhiḥ saha gaganatalād avatīrya bhagavataḥ pādau śirobhir vanditvā 
tripradakṣiṇīkṛṭya bhagavantam etad avocat)“O Lord, the tathāgata, Ekaratnavyūha asked after your health - if you have l
ittle trouble, little discomfort, and little unrest; if you are strong, and living in touch with supreme happiness (bhag
avan tathāgata ekaratnavyūho ’lpābādhatāṃ ca paripṛcchaty alpātaṅkatāṃ ca laghutthānatāṃ ca yātrāṃ ca balaṃ ca sukhaṃ cā
navadyatāṃ ca sparśavihāratāṃ ca).And he said that the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja and the twelve koṭis of b
odhisatvas had wanted to hear about (śrotukāma) the exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya), a chapter of the Great Colle
ction (mahāsannipātaparivarta), so please be kind to let them thus return when they are empowered by all such dharmas an
d equipped with the words of dharma.”Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja sustained (adhiṣṭhita) the jewel-canopy (ratnacchat
tra) of ten thousand yojanas high over the Lord’s lion throne in the space, joined the palms of his hands (añjali), bowe
d down to the Lord (abhivandana), and praised the Lord with these suitable verses (etābhir gāthābhiḥ sārūpyābhir abhiṣṭū
ya),
