PuṣpavarṣaGaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 4Then the bodhisatva, the great being named Āśupratibhāna joined this assembly, w
as seated with them, and said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja (atha khalu āśupratibhāno nāma bodhisatvo mahāsatvo tat
raiva pariṣadi sannipatito ’bhūt sanniṣaṇṇo gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvaṃ etad avocat):.“Son of good family, if your name is 
Gaganagañja, is this open space (gagana) your treasury (gañja)?”Gaganagañja said: “So it is, son of good family, the ope
n space is my treasury (gagano mama gañjaḥ).”Āśupratibhāna said: “Son of good family, let us see the distinction of open
space and treasury (gaganagañjaviśeṣa).Then the Lord said this to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (atha kha
lu bhagavān gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvam mahāsatvam idam avocat):“Son of good family, let us see the distinction of open spa
ce and treasury.”Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said this to the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna:“Whatever you want, son of go
od family, I will pour it down from open space as a rain.”Then the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna made a wish:“I have seen a l
otus flower called ‘Sarvaprabhāvavairocana’ in the Padmavyūha universe of the Tathāgata Śrīratnotpala, that would be one
krośa wide,consisting of hundred koṭis of young and tender petals,is pleasant to touch like soft cloth (kācilindika),ha
s a fragrance (gandha) which filled the Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra),and has many hundred thousand colors (varṇa).Thus w
hen the bodhisatvas see the lotus flower, they are in rapture and unable to take their eyes off it.By seeing the lotus f
lower and by smelling its fragrance, the bodhisatvas attain concentration (samādhi).Please pour down the rain of such lo
tus flowers on us.”Immediately after the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna made a wish thus, by the magical presence of the bodhi
satva Gaganagañja (gaganagañjādhiṣṭhāna), the rain of such lotus flowers began to pour down from the vault of the sky (g
aganatala).Then, by smelling the lotus flowers, the whole assembly entered into the concentration called Prītyāhāra.Havi
ng emerged from the concentration, the whole assembly bowed to the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna, and said:“The magical prese
nce of the good man (satpurṣādhiṣṭhāna) and the power of insight (prajñābala) are good, these are good.May all living be
ings attain magical presence such as this (sarvasatvā īdṛśasya adhiṣṭhānasya lābhino bhavantu)!”
