15. BodhisatvacaryāHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva perform his practice of a bodhisatva (bodhisatvacary
ā) after having obtained the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatā)?The extinction (nirvāṇa) is the pacification of all 
vices (sarvakleśapraśamana),the allaying of every feeling (sarvavedanāpratipraśrambhaṇa),the pacification of all objects
(sarvālambanapraśamana),and no connection (pratisaṃdhi) with the parts of personality, spheres or fields of perception 
(skandhadhātvāyatana).Thus the good man (satpuruṣa), having obtained the sameness of extiction (nirvāṇasamatā), playfull
y employs (vikrīḍita) the great compassion (mahākaruṇā), means and insight (prajñopāya), and knowledge (jñāna) of the fo
rmer lives (pūrvanivāsa);he is sustained by the presence of the Buddhas (buddhādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhitai);he cultivates insigh
t (prajñā) and knowledge (jñāna);he purifies cultivation (bhavānā) by means of the clear presence of manifestation (bhāv
ānapariśuddhi);he depends on concentration (samādhi) which is the miraculous play (vikrīḍita) with illusion (māyā);The v
ices by which he might produce existence and bonds of existence, these he does away with (yaiḥ kleśaḥ saṃsāraṃ saṃsāraba
ndhanaṃ vā prabhāvayati tān prajahāti), and the knowledge by means of which he teaches extinction, in that he excels (ye
na jñānena nirvāṇaṃ deśayati tatra vaśitāprāptaḥ), thus he is born from non-existence and originated form non-originatio
n (anutpādotpanno ’bhūtabhūtaḥ).Even though he is established in the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatāsaṃprasthita),
he still does not interrupt bringing living beings to maturity (satvaparipāka).This, son of good family, is the gate of
knowledge (jñānamukha), called the development of two approaches (yamakapariṇāma), [namely the great compassion (mahākā
ruṇā) and expedient means (upāya)] of the bodhisatvas, and even though the bodhisatva is placed in the gate of knowledge
after having obtained the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatā), he still performs the practice of a bodhisatva (bodhi
satvacaryā).
