9. BuddhānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection of the Buddha, which is authorized by the Lord for bod
hisatvas? (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvasya buddhānujñātā buddhānusmṛtiḥ).a) while recollecting the Buddha from the 
perspective of morality (śīla), he never gives up (asaṃpramoṣata) unsullied morality (anāsravaśīla);b) while recollectin
g the Buddha in the perspective concentration (samādhi), he is changeless (nirvikāra) concerning the sphere of the momen
ts of existence (dharmadhātu) being always same;c) while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of insight (prajñā
), he is free from thought-constructions (nirvikalpa) since there is no activity in all moments of existence (sarvadharm
āpracāra);d) while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of liberation (vimukti), he does not stay in the seconda
ry-thought (dvitīyacitta);e) while recollection the Buddha from the perspective of the vision of the knowledge of libera
tion (vimuktijñānadarśana), he is not attached (asakta) to any knowledge (sarvajñāna);f) while recollecting the Buddha f
rom the perspective of power (bala), he is not moving (āniñjya) concerning the knowledge which is equanimous in all thre
e times (tryadhvasamata);g) while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of fearlessness (vaiśāradya), he does not
stay with any defilement (sarvāsravaḥ sārdhaṃ na saṃvasati);h) while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of al
l qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharma), he does not have any false discrimination in the sameness of the sphere o
f all moments of existence (dharmadhātusamatāṃ na vikalpayati).Furthermore, the recollection of the Buddha is not to see
(na samanupaśyati) the Lord from his material body (rūpasvabhāva), but to be in accordance with the knowledge of recoll
ection through understanding the nature of the material form;it is not to see the Lord from his feeling, perception, for
mative factors or consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna), but to be in accordance with the knowledge of recollectio
n through understanding their nature;it is not to see the Lord from his parts of personality, spheres or fields of perce
ption (skandhadhātvāyatana), but to be in accordance with the knowledge of recollection through understanding their natu
re.Again, since he understands the essence of all moments of existence (sarvadharmasvabhāvajñānena), the recollection of
the great insight (mahāprajñānusmṛti) is beyond any mental effort (sarvamanasikāra) and the arising (paryuttāna) of any
viewpoint (sarvadṛṣṭi);Since in this way recollection is pure (anāvila), the knowledge of the application of awareness 
(smṛtyupsthānajñāna) is called the recollection of the Buddha which is taught by the Lord.Further, the recollection of t
he Buddha is not to be attached to any of the Lord’s ways of behavior (sarveryapatha), to wit: standing (sthita), walkin
g (caṃkrama), sitting (niṣadya), sleeping (śayana), going (gati), coming (āgati), speaking (pravyāhāra), and not speakin
g (apravyāhāra).Since there is no attachment, he does not recollect recollection nor recollect non-recollection.Since th
ere is no mental effort in recollection (asmṛtimanasikāra), he does not recollect the Buddha in the perspective of form,
distinguishing marks or any state of things (rūpalakṣaṇadharmatā).There is no involvement with any distinguishing mark 
or object (sarvanimittālambanāsamudācāra), son of good family, this is therefore the recollection of the Buddha, which i
s authorized by the Lord.
