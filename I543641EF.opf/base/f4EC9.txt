The Bodhisatvas, the great beings had assembled from many different buddha-fields and they were innumerable, endless, and
inexpressible. With him was also a great assembly of ineffable bodhisatvas. (nānābuddhakṣetrasaṃnipatitair bodhisatvama
hāsatvāprameyāpramāṇābhilapyair mahābhilapyabodhisatvagaṇena sārdhaṃ);skilled in transmigration through infinite buddha-
field in an instant (sarvacittakṣaṇikānantabuddhakṣetragatikuśalaiḥ);had always worshipped the Tathāgatas, skilled in pa
ying homage to [them](sarvatathāgatapūjopasthānakuśalair);sought to receive teachings (atṛptadharmaparyeṣṭibhiḥ);constan
tly striving to throughly mature all sentient beings (satatasamitaṃ sarvasatvaparipācanānuyuktaiḥ);attained the perfecti
on of the best skillful means and knowledge (prajñopāyaparamapāramitābhir);thoroughly established in unobstructed emanci
pation (anāvaraṇamokṣapratiṣṭhitaiḥ);perfectly transcended all mental constructions and conceptual consciousness (sarvak
alpavikalpaprapañcasamatikrāntaiḥ);near to the stage of omniscience. They were like this. (sarvajñajñānāsannībhūtais tad

atvas, the great beings (evaṃ pramukhair asaṃkhyeyāprameyāpramāṇācintyāsamāmeyair bodhisatvair mahāsatvaiḥ).[they were] 
infinite, ineffable, again ineffable (aprameyānabhilāpyānabhilāpyaiḥ sārdham);

II. Introduction

Then The Lord revealed the exposition of religion entitled the chapter of The Great Colleciton to bodhisatvas, the great 
beings (atha khalu bhagavān mahāsaṃnipātaparivartaṃ nāma dharmaparyāyaṃ bodhisatvānāṃ mahāsatvānāṃ prakāśayati sma mahās
aṃnipātaparivarte dharmaparyāye nirdiśyamāne).Below is the reconstruction of the Dharmakṣema version as corresponding to
and based on Akṣ p. 17,6ff. There seems to be some, but fairly few differences from the Tibetan Akṣ text as reconstruct
ed into Sanskrit.atha khalu bhagavān bodhisatvacaryāpraveśaniryātyanāvaraṇamukhaṃ nāma dharmaparyāyaṃ, bodhisatvamārgavy

g in the pavilion in the vault of the sky (sarvāvatī parṣad aham gaganatale mahāvyūhakūṭāgārāntara āsanna iti)."The disp
lay of these marvelous pavilions illuminated the sight of living beings (teṣām eva kūṭāgārārāṇāṃ vyūhaḥ satvānāṃ darśana
pathe ’vabhāsayati sma).Except for the bodhisatvas, the great beings, the great disciples, the highest gods, snake-gods,
demons and celestial musicians who were seated in the pavilions, the rest of the beings in this system of threefold tho
usand great thousands of worlds, appearing as a form, was eclipsed. All of them thought "I am just like space." (kūṭāgār
eṣu niṣaṇṇān bodhisatvān mahāsatvān mahāśrāvakāṃś ca punar api devanāgayakṣagandharvān tān sarvān sthāpayitvā trisahasra
mahāsahasralokadhātuṣu anavabhāsān abhūvann te 'pi gaganāsanna iti)As the empty space at the end of the aeon, the manife
stations of forms in the great three-thousand of worlds disappeared from the sight of anyone (tadyathā kalpaparyavasāne 
gaganasamā bhavanti trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātuṣu rūpāvabhāsā ye kecit anavabhāsā bhavanti tadā ye rūpāvabhāsāḥ satve
bhyaḥ darśanapathe anavabhāsitāḥ).These pavilions were illuminated like the pavilions which bodhisatvas had stayed in th
e Mahāvyūha universe of the tathāgāta Ekaratnavyūha.Except for those who were sitting in the pavilion in the sky, the re
st of them in the great three-thousand of worlds, staying on the surface of the earth, as far as its foundations, though
t that they had disappeared. Also the king of the mountain, Mt. Sumeru, Mt. Cakravāḍa, and Mt. Mahācakravāḍa (parvatarāj
asumerucakravāḍamahācakravāḍa) disappeared from the sight of living beings.Villages, towns, market-towns, royal cities, 
capitals (grāmanagaranigamarāṣṭrarājadhānī) were also eclipsed. However, with the lion’s throne (simhāsana) of the Lord 
it was another matter, they perceived it as shining ten thousand yojanas high as placed in these pavilions placed in the
vault of the sky.By the light of the lion’s throne on which the Lord was seated, the great three-thousand thousands of 
worlds were illumined with a grand lustre. The great three-thousand of worlds, the sun, the moon, the stars, Indra, Brah
ma, and the the protectors of the world (trisahasramahāsahasralokadhātor candrasūryajyotiṣa śakrabrahmalokapālānām avabh
āsa), all of them were eclipsed (dhyāmīkṛta).When that whole assembly of bodhisatvas saw these miracles, wonders, and am
azing phenomena (prātihāryāścaryādbhuta), they said to one another: “It would not be easy for us to see such an exceptio
nal grandeur as the splendor of this pavilion even if our lifetime would fill an aeon (kalpasthitikāyuḥpramāṇa). Thus th
e virtues of these pavilions (kūṭāgārāṇāṃ guṇavyūhāḥ) are immeasurable.”
