Brahmā Sahāṃpati

Then the Lord said to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Then, son of good family, I will invoke the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā (
brahmā sahāṃpati), and because of that he will continue protecting this exposition of religion. The words of invoking is
as follows:tadyathā | maitre | śubhamaitre | dharmamaitre | maitryānusahite samaitre | sandhimaitre | anugamamaitre | a

ātikramabuddhādhiṣṭhānāṃ |Those treasuries of open space are the words of invoking the Brahā, the lord of Sahā.”Then the
Brahmā, the lord of Sahā, dwelling in the heaven of Brahmā (brahmaloka), became aware of the presence of the buddha (bu
ddhādhiṣṭhāna), heard these words of friendly mantra (maitrīmantra) by the power of the Buddha (buddhānubhāva), namely t
he sphere of divine hearing (divyaśrotradhātu), together with sixty-eight hundred thousand Brahmās, approached to the Lo
rd, prostrated himself at the Lord’s feet, and sat down on a side.Having sat down on a side, the Brahmā, the lord of Sah
ā, addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, since we are sustained by the presence of the tathāgata (tathāgatādhiṣṭhānādh
iṣṭhita), we will be endowed with friendliness and compassion (maitrīkaruṇā) and strive for this exposition of religion.
As for the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka), who, having collected this teaching of the buddha, understand it, retain it,
read it, teach it, and make it into a book (pustaka), wherever they hold religious discourses (dharmakathā) in the wild
erness (araṇya), forest (utpathamārga), village (sagrāma), city (nagara), town (nigama), kingdom (rāṣṭra) or capital (rā
jadhāni), if they explain this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) in detail, then we will protect them, shield them,
guard them, rejoice them, fulfill energy (bala), attain recollection (smṛti), acquire intelligence (mati), be accordanc
e with realization (prativedha), fulfill eloquence (pratibhāna), inspire the unbelieving with faith, and liberate those 
who have faith. According to the tathāgata’s guiding principle of the dharma (tathāgatadharmanaya), Lord, we will uphold
and disseminate it”At these words, the Lord said this to the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā: “Excellent, excellent, Brahmā, s
ince you uphold the true dharma, the tathāgata rejoices in you.Just as I am turning the wheel of the dharma (dharmacakra
), just so, Brahmā, you also will before long turn it.Just as you are upholding my true dharma, just so other Brahmās wi
ll uphold your true dharma.”
