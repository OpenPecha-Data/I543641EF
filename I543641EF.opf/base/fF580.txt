VyākaraṇaWhen this decisive teaching was declared, seventy-two millions of gods, humans, asuras, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, and
other beings produced the thought of incomparable complete awakening (iha dharmaniścaye nirdiśyamāne dvisaptatidevamānu
ṣāsurakinnaramahoragaprāṇiniyutānām anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpāditāni);thirty-two thousand bodhisatvas atta
ined the tolerance that all things are unborn (dvātriṃśatīnāṃ ca bodhisatvasahasrāṇām anutpattikadharmakṣāntiḥ pratilabd
hā);this world system of three thousandfold worlds was shaken in its six ways (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātuś ca ṣaḍvik
āraḥ prakampito abhūt);and the world was illuminated by a grand lustre (avabhāsa).A hundred thousand gods, having let fa
ll the rain of flowers (puṣpavarṣa) and played the celestial cymbals (tūrya), uttered a joyous utterance (udānam udānaya
ti): “Living beings who, having heard this teaching, believe it, embrace it, practice it, and proceed to the realm of th
e Buddha (buddhaviṣaya).All the Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra), where the Awakened Lords appear, are adorned with ornament
s and respected by the wise.Why is that? When the Buddhas appear, such dharma will be taught, and the good men (satpurṣa
) endowed with inconceivable qualities (acintyadharma) will see it.”Then the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja, ha
ving heard the Buddha’s prediction (vyākaraṇa), being delighted, offered to the body of the Buddha with a net of pearls 
(muktājāla) having an immaculate and pure radiance (vimalaviśuddhaprabha) with the value of pearls filling the three tho
usandfold world-system, and then he addressed himself to the Lord:“The knowledge of the Awakened Lords is free from any 
attachment or obstruction; his teaching is without interruption; and the Tathāgata sees the thoughts of all living being
s and is skilled in knowing the superior or inferior abilities of them (indriyavarāvarajñāna).Since the Lord teaches suc
h guiding principle of the dharma (dharmanaya), all congregations are satisfied,the great vehicle (mahāyāna) is praised,
and the bodhisatvas, having been assembled from the worlds of ten directions (daśadiglokadhātu), were praised with this 
great light of the dharma.Since the Lord Tathāgata teaches the entrance into the dharma (dharmamukha) to us, based on th
e entrance into the source of the dharma, we will teach the immeasurable entrance into the dharma.
