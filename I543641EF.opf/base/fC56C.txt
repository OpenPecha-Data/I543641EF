Son of good family, there are eight purities of the insight of the bodhisatvas. What are the eight? (ime kulputra aṣṭaviś
uddhayo bodhisatvasya prajñā gaganasamā bhavati. kathame aṣṭau)To with, a) although they attain all good qualities (sarv
akuśaladharmasamudāgamata), they do not stick to the view of eternity (śāśvatadṛṣṭi);b) although they strive to get rid 
of all bad qualities (sarvākuśaladharmaprahāṇavīryārambha), they do not fall into the view of annihilation (uccheda);c) 
although they enter into dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādapraveśa), they are not contradictory (virudhyate) with 
the tolerance that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti);d) although they illuminate four kinds of special kno
wledge (catasraḥ pratisaṃvida), they are not attached to interpretation and eloquence (niruktipratibhāna);e) although th
ey teach four summaries of the dharma (dharmoddāna), they never see anything (na samanupaśyanti) in impermanence, suffer
ing, selfless, or quiescence (anityaduḥkhānātmaśānta);f) although they teach to enter into action and duties (karmakāryā
vatāra), they are free from karmic result (vipāka) and also not disturbed by performing deeds (karmakāra);g) although th
ey are established in the knowledge of teachings (dharmajñāna) which is beyond discursive thinking (niṣprapañca), they e
lucidate the division of words of all teachings (sarvadharmapadaprabheda);h) they attain the illumination of all teachin
gs (sarvadharmāloka) and teach living beings about impurity and purification (saṃkleśavyavadāna).Those eight are, son of
good family, the pure insights of the bodhisatvas.
